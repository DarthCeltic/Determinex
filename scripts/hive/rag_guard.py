"""
scripts/hive/rag_guard.py — RAG Ingestion Safety Layer
=======================================================
Centralises the three Red Team mitigations that protect the vector ingestion
pipeline from catastrophic failures and credential leaks.

#14 OOM-Bomb Artifact Guard
    fastembed (ONNX CPU) attempting to embed a 300MB Rust target/ binary or
    a 50MB app.log causes the host RAM to fill instantly, triggering the OS
    OOM killer which vaporises the Rust orchestrator silently.
    Mitigation: hard file-size cap + magic byte binary rejection before any
    file content reaches the embedding model.

#24 Ghost Vector Sync
    Deleting a file and rolling back to a snapshot (Step N rollback) does NOT
    automatically remove the stale embeddings from sqlite-vec/ChromaDB. Over
    hours the vector index fills with "ghost embeddings" pointing at deleted
    or superseded code. Sentinel retrieves broken code from the past and the
    DAG resurrects already-proven-bad logic in an infinite loop.
    Mitigation: checksum diff between live filesystem and vector index;
    DELETE any embedding whose source file hash no longer matches disk.

#27 Secret Key Absolute Denylist
    See workspace.py for the primary denylist. This module exposes the same
    guard for callers that operate outside the workspace hash path (e.g. a
    standalone RAG ingestor CLI).
