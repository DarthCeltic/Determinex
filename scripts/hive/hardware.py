# ── Ollama Modelfile auto-calibration ─────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Called during model registration so every user gets a Modelfile tuned to
# their hardware.  Two problems this solves:
#
# 1. VRAM starvation (DWM lag):
#    num_gpu 99 tries to load ALL layers into VRAM. When the model is larger
#    than the card (e.g. 7.2 GB sentinel on a 6 GB card), Windows DWM is left
#    with <0.6 GB of VRAM — causing UI stuttering and mouse lag.
#    Fix: reserve 1.0 GB for DWM on Windows, 0.5 GB on Linux/Mac.
#    If the model fits after reserving headroom → num_gpu 99.
#    If not → compute the fraction of layers that fits and use that count.
#
# 2. CPU chokehold at ~50% utilisation:
#    50–51 % CPU with hyperthreading = 100 % of physical cores pinned.
#    Fix: cap inference threads at (physical_cores − 2), leaving two physical
#    cores permanently free for the OS and UI.

# Approximate transformer layer counts by model size class.
# Used only when the model doesn't fit in VRAM and we need to compute a layer
# fraction.  Close enough for Modelfile generation; not used in scoring.
