determinex_pb_triage.py -- adjudicator-as-router: don't grind the unreachable (priority D)
=======================================================================================
For every not-locked tool, decide EARLY where compute goes, from its fingerprint:

  AUTOFIX   residual is mostly MECH-class with a BUILT fixer  -> apply technique, cheap, do now
  AMPLIFY   residual is SAMPLE/SOLVE and f-evidence > 0        -> pour compute (best-of-K / decompose)
  OPUS      genuine-missing/semantic, no mechanism, p unclear  -> hand-loop: Opus context + corpus verify
  CEILING   upstream-skip / proven unprovisionable             -> certify w/ evidence, STOP grinding

The point (your insight): keeping p≈0 walls OUT of the grind is half of what keeps the curve
climbing. A tool whose residual is all upstream-skips is DONE-as-ceiling, not a target. A tool
with f=0 + only MECH residual is a cheap autofix. Only the genuine SAMPLE/SOLVE tail gets the
expensive compute. This routes effort to where p>0 and parks where p≈0.
