"""Human approval gate for source mutation.

This gate is the *only* place the apparatus says "yes, this verified
temp-workspace patch may be applied to the original repo." It does NOT
perform the apply itself — the IDE/CLI layer downstream consumes a
``SOURCE_MUTATION_APPROVAL_ACCEPTED_FIXTURE`` decision and is responsible
for the actual write (under its own audited path).

Rule: source mutation remains blocked by default. To open the gate, the
caller must supply an :class:`ApprovalPacket` that:

  1. References the exact trace_id of a previously-emitted
     :class:`VerifiedRepairTrace`.
  2. Carries the sha256 of the temp-workspace unified diff that matches
     the trace's safe_patch_result.unified_diff.
  3. Matches the trace's workspace identity bit-for-bit.
  4. Reports the verifier as having passed on the temp workspace
     (``PATCH_VERIFIER_PASSED_TEMP_ONLY``).
  5. Carries a non-empty operator id and an approval_token.

Anything missing → blocked, with a specific status token explaining
which check failed.

The gate is a pure function. It performs no I/O. It does not write to
the original repo.
