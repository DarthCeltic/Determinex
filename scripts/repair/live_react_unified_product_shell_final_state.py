"""DETERMINEX_LIVE_REACT_UNIFIED_PRODUCT_SHELL_FINAL_STATE_LOCK_001 evaluator.

Rung 10 (finale). Reads the six prior rungs' lock manifests on
disk and asserts:

NOTE (2026-07-20): originally nine rungs. Three (idea_lab_panel,
proof_operator_center_panel, splash_demo_panel) were removed from this
requirement set because their panels + locks + tests were deleted in
commit 30b3ff570 ("chore: land pending IDE product shell archive"), which
determined ~74 ide-product-shell panels including these were a
Claude<->Codex tandem-pipeline trail, not real durable features. This
finale test kept requiring their (now-deleted) lock files, which is a
stale check pointing at deliberately-removed work, not a real gap --
re-creating fake panels just to satisfy it would be reintroducing the
exact thing that archival cleanup correctly removed.

  * Each rung's lock manifest exists, parses, declares the right
    lock_id, and scope_discipline keeps source_mutation_authorized
    AND training open-keys False.
  * Each rung's evidence_run_artifact exists on disk.
  * Aggregate invariants stay False (source_mutation_authorized,
    training_eligible, release_ready).
  * unsupported_claims_blocked stays True (no rung opened an
    all-app / all-language / no-followup claim key).

Read-only on disk. Never re-runs runtime gates.
