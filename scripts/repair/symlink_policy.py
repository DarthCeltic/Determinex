"""Workspace symlink policy.

CLAUDE-AUTH-009 remediation: previously the snapshot/restore path
silently dereferenced symlinks (Path.is_file() follows symlinks;
shutil.copy2 / shutil.copytree(symlinks=False) follow symlinks).
A workspace containing a hostile symlink (e.g. pointing at
/etc/passwd) would have TARGET content snapshotted and then
restored as a regular file.

This module enforces a conservative policy: if the workspace contains
any symlink under it, snapshot/apply/rollback refuse to proceed.

Why refuse rather than preserve: preserving symlink semantics across
a snapshot/restore involves recording the link target as metadata
and reconstructing the link at restore time. That introduces
complexity (cross-platform link semantics, symlink-of-symlink chains,
non-existing targets) that the apparatus does not need today. A
clean refusal is auditable; the operator can resolve the workspace
to a symlink-free state before retrying.
