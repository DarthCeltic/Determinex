"""Vocabulary classifier for CLAUDE_AUTH_005_READY_AUTHORIZED_LANGUAGE_LOCK_001.

The Claude IDE / repair / frontend lane uses status tokens with a
range of meanings. This module is the single source of truth for
mapping a given token to one of the 8 disjoint authority classes
in ready_authorized_vocabulary_record.AUTHORITY_VOCABULARY_CLASSES.

Critical invariant — enforced by tests:

  * No ``*_READY`` token classifies into a class in
    CLASSES_THAT_IMPLY_AUTHORIZATION.
  * No token containing the substring ``READY`` may be confused
    with ``AUTHORIZED``.
  * ``*_FIXTURE`` approval tokens classify as
    ``approval_present`` but NEVER ``source_mutation_authorized``.

The classifier does NOT mutate the existing token surface. It
adds a layer that an operator or downstream agent can consult to
distinguish a capability signal from an authorization signal.
