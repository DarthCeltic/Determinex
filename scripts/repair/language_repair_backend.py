"""
Cross-language repair factory interface.

Every language backend implements this protocol. The pipeline contract is:

    find project
    → understand project (detect_project)
    → prove project works (baseline)
    → break it in a controlled way (inject_failure)
    → repair it (repair)
    → verify the repair (verify)
    → sign the trace (write_corpus)
    → train/compress/reroute from the trace

Language expansion is factory work, not invention.
