determinex_route_ab.py -- measure what the Model Router actually saves
=====================================================================
Runs the SAME specs twice and compares:

  arm "always"  -- one model does every step (the always-frontier baseline)
  arm "routed"  -- DETERMINEX_ROUTE=1 with a ladder, cheapest rung first

The comparison that matters is routed vs ALWAYS-FRONTIER, not routed vs
route-off. Route-off uses the configured local builder, which is free, so
"routing vs route-off" would show routing costing MORE and answer nothing. The
claim being tested is "don't send every step to the expensive model", so the
baseline has to be the expensive model doing every step.

WHAT IT REPORTS, AND WHY THE ESCALATION RATE IS FIRST
-----------------------------------------------------
A router that never escalates reports 100% savings, which is not a result -- it
means the task set was too easy to exercise the mechanism. So the escalation
rate is printed before any cost figure: if it is 0, the cost number is
meaningless and this script says so rather than letting it read as a win.

Real spend is read from logs/api_ledger/providers.jsonl (the ledger every cloud
call already appends to), not from the router's own relative `est_cost`. With an
all-local ladder both arms are genuinely $0 and the script reports that plainly
instead of manufacturing a percentage.
