"""Promote a Rule B sidecar entry into the official Rule A ledger via clean rebase.

The Rule B promotion sat in `rule_b_promotions.jsonl` because the candidate's
runnable count differed from the baseline's. The legitimate path to making
it official:

    1. Treat the Rule B candidate's eval as the NEW baseline.
       The runnable count it observed (e.g. 398) becomes the canonical surface.
    2. Repack the same source override (no code change — we are certifying
       stability, not advancing it).
    3. Run the official eval again. Two runs of the same deterministic binary
       against the same surface should produce the same passed count.
    4. Gate the second eval against the FIRST Rule B eval in explicit
       stable-certification mode. If the second run passes >= the first AND
       has 0 regressions AND runnable is stable, it accepts under Rule A and
       enters `accepted_runs.jsonl` + the lock board's `best_*` fields cleanly.

This script orchestrates that. It does NOT touch the candidate's source —
the only thing that changes between the two runs is the baseline JSON we
compare against.

Usage:
    python scripts/pb_rule_b_promote.py <slug> --new-run-root <path>

Where:
    <slug>         the same slug that was in rule_b_promotions.jsonl
    --new-run-root the run root for the SECOND eval (must be distinct from the
                   Rule B run root so packing doesn't clobber the prior result).
                   The script will pack into this dir, run the eval, then gate.

Exit codes:
    0 = promoted (Rule A accept written to official ledger)
    1 = second eval did not match (regression or runnable changed again);
        the Rule B entry stays in the sidecar, no official ledger touch
    2 = infrastructure error (missing sidecar entry, missing override, etc.)
    3 = bad arguments
