radeon_full_demo.py — the whole argument, live against the Radeon, in one pass.

The submission's main demo replays evidence captured from an instance that was destroyed, and
says so on screen. That was honest and it was also the weakest thing about it: a rival entry
in the same problem space executes live. The instance came back, so this runs live.

Everything below hits the card. Nothing is read from a file, and the one thing this CANNOT
show is stated rather than faked: `rocm-smi` needs a shell on the box, and this drives the
vLLM endpoint through the instance's tunnel, so the hardware is evidenced by what is serving
and how it behaves under load rather than by a driver readout.

Structure follows the argument, not the feature list:
    1  the model is served on the GPU
    2  what one candidate costs
    3  what the Kth candidate costs -- the AMD argument
    4  where the ceiling is, and that the declared one is not the measured one
    5  the loop refusing to claim what it cannot verify, then earning it
