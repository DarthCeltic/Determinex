"""PreToolUse hook: surface what the corpus already knows before a file is edited.

WHY A HOOK AND NOT A DOCUMENTED STEP
------------------------------------
AUDIT BEFORE BUILD is already the project's stated rule, and it is already in CLAUDE.md.
It still did not prevent the num_ctx bug from being rediscovered on 2026-08-01, for two
compounding reasons: the knowledge existed only as a code comment in one module (so no
query could have found it -- see class knowledge_that_lives_only_in_a_code_comment), and
consulting the corpus required already suspecting there was something to consult.

A rule that depends on remembering to follow it fails exactly when someone is deep in a
problem, which is when it matters. This makes the consult automatic and costs one JSON
read of a file that is already on disk.

ADVISORY, NEVER BLOCKING. It prints context and exits 0 unconditionally. A hook that can
block an edit because a keyword matched would be disabled within a day, and a disabled
hook surfaces nothing at all.
