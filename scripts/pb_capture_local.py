"""Autonomous PRIVATE score-capture: pull the box's best eval_reports into the repo and commit
LOCALLY ONLY -- never push. The eval results stay on this machine + the box (both private); nothing
goes to a remote anyone else can see (operator mandate 2026-06-29). Run by a scheduled task every
~30min so box7's results are continuously captured + the BEST per tool is kept (pb_sync.capture_scores
already does the best-eval merge). Pairs with determinex_pb_autodrive._persist_best (the box keeps its
own best) -- this brings that best down to the durable repo.
