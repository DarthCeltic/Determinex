A claim is a statement that can be independently checked as true or false against a knowledge base. Extract:
- Factual claims: X is Y, X happened in Z, X has property Y
- Procedural claims: To do X you must Y, X works by doing Y
- Causal claims: X causes Y, X results in Z
- Definitional claims: X means Y, X is defined as Z

Do NOT extract:
- Opinions or value judgements ("this is better than")
- Tautologies or obvious truths
- Claims from the original question/context (only from the response)
- Hedged claims with "may", "might", "possibly" unless clearly asserting

Each claim should be atomic (one assertion) and self-contained (no pronouns without referent)."""
