"""rubric_decomposer.py — Learn feature weights from a preference rubric.

Two modes:
  1. Zero-shot: given rubric text, use LLM to estimate feature importances
  2. Supervised: given (response, score) examples, fit sklearn LinearRegression

The output is a weight vector over FeatureChecker.STANDARD_CHECKS that
maximally predicts the preference score from atomic feature results.
