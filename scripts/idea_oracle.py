"""
idea_oracle.py — Discovery conversation before spec generation

Replaces the "instant MD spec" approach with a guided conversation:
  --mode discover  : Analyze raw idea → return path cards + opening Oracle message
  --mode converse  : Continue conversation → Oracle response + ready-to-spec flag
                     Full conversation history is read from stdin as JSON array

When ready_to_spec=True, the frontend calls spec_generator.py with the full
conversation context so the spec is written once, informed by everything.

Complexity: low=days to 1 week, medium=1-4 weeks, high=months

SCOPE RULE:
- Honor the user's requested surface before any simplicity default.
- If the user asks for website, web app, browser app, dashboard, portal, or frontend, include Web App.
- If the user asks for mobile, phone, iOS, Android, native app, app store, or play store, include Mobile App.
- If the user asks for both web/website and mobile/app, the FIRST path must be Web + Mobile App with a shared backend.
- Suggest CLI Tool only when the user explicitly asks for CLI, command-line, terminal, shell, or console behavior.
- Suggest API/backend when the user mentions server, API, backend, endpoint, multiple users, auth, or a web/mobile client.
- Only suggest database if the user explicitly mentions accounts, persistence, records, sync, or scale.
- For personal tools with no product surface: JSON file persistence is a fine default."""
