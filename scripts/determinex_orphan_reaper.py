determinex_orphan_reaper.py -- kill eval tool binaries that escaped cleanup
========================================================================
WHY: the observe/reimpl runners launch a tool binary (the reference `./executable` or a compiled
candidate) under a parent Python. If that PARENT dies mid-run (stall-detector SIGKILL, crash, a
higher-level timeout), the child binary reparents to init (ppid==1) and keeps running -- a 27h
100%-CPU `json-tui ./executable /tmp/jt_*.json` orphan was the live proof. hardened_runner is
called under threads, so PR_SET_PDEATHSIG (die-with-parent) via preexec_fn is unsafe (fork-in-
thread deadlock); a periodic reaper is the safe net for this parent-death class.

CONSERVATIVE BY DESIGN -- only ever kills a process that is ALL of:
  * ppid == 1            (reparented orphan; an in-progress eval's child still has the eval as parent)
  * etimes > REAP_AGE    (default 1200s/20min -- WAY beyond any per-probe timeout of 10-60s)
  * comm NOT a service / orchestrator / build tool / shell (explicit allowlist-by-exclusion)
  * AND (runs from an eval temp/workspace dir  OR  is pegging CPU > CPU_RUNAWAY)
So the python orchestrators (autodrive/reimpl), redis, docker, ollama, sshd, compilers, and any
live eval are never touched. Run from cron every few minutes; logs each kill to syslog + stdout.

Usage:
  python3 determinex_orphan_reaper.py            # arm: kill matching orphans
  python3 determinex_orphan_reaper.py --dry-run  # list what WOULD be killed, kill nothing
