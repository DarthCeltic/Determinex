determinex_pb_lock_registry.py -- the single source of truth for genuine PB locks
===============================================================================
THE FIX for the lying board. Lock status was scattered across THREE records that
the 2026-06-10 bulk pass degraded inconsistently: eval_index `official_full_suite_resolved`,
`logs/programbench_lock_board.json`, and the CLAUDE.md prose list. A degraded archive
kept its stale "100%" in one record while the artifact no longer reproduced -> the board
lied and nothing re-checked (the 5 eval-integrity failure modes).

This registry is ONE place. A tool is in `verified_locks.json` ONLY when a cache-cleared
archive eval proved passed==total (0 not_run / 0 skipped / 0 failed), and the entry pins
the sha256 of BOTH the eval_report and the submission tarball that produced it. If the
tarball changes (any bulk edit), its sha no longer matches -> the lock is automatically
UNVERIFIED until re-eval. Staleness becomes impossible by construction.

  VERIFIED      -> in registry, tarball sha matches  -> the canonical lock set (the "one place")
  NEEDS_REVERIFY-> was a lock but artifact changed / never registered -> must re-eval to enter
  NEGATIVE      -> everything else (degraded-unrecoverable, partial-not_run, gated reject,
                   ceiling, RED cheat) -> emitted as NEGATIVE TRAINING SIGNAL

Negative signal teaches the flywheel what is NOT a genuine lock and why -- contrastive
examples, gated by the legitimacy classifier (RED cheats are negative; they never train as
positive). Written to pb_negative_signal.jsonl with the exclusion-schema convention.

Usage:
  python scripts/determinex_pb_lock_registry.py reconcile         # 3-bucket report
  python scripts/determinex_pb_lock_registry.py verify <tool> <eval_report.json>   # register if clean
  python scripts/determinex_pb_lock_registry.py emit-negative     # write negative signal for non-verified
