"""Compatibility entrypoint for the day-one public claim scanner.

The current canonical authority scanner is `scripts/governance/overclaim_guard.py`.
This wrapper preserves the older release-runbook command shape:

    python scripts/claim_scanner/day_one_public_claim_scanner.py --root .
    python scripts/claim_scanner/day_one_public_claim_scanner.py --print

It scans tracked public claim surfaces for authority anchors asserted true
without proof. It does not grant release readiness.

#: Trees that are not Determinex's claims. `node_modules/` was already here; `.vscode-test/` is the
#: same kind of thing and was missed because nothing had created one until 2026-07-31, when the
#: extension-host harness began caching a full VS Code (1,995 files, several hundred of them JSON
#: manifests the scanner then parsed). The scan went from ~5 s to over its own 90 s timeout, and
#: `test_day_one_public_claim_scanner_compat` failed as a TIMEOUT rather than a finding — which is
#: the right way to notice, but the wrong thing to be noticing.
#:
#: A downloaded toolchain cache makes no claims about Determinex. Both entries are gitignored build
#: caches; neither is ever published.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT adding `.tmp/` alongside it, though it is also large and gitignored: it holds the
#: generated `SETUP.md` that ships inside the download ZIP, which is user-facing text this scanner
#: should keep reading. `.tmp/` was already being scanned before tonight and was never the
#: bottleneck — widening the skip list past the actual cause would have quietly cost real coverage.
