determinex_pb_provenance_guard.py -- anti-test-gaming guard (the credibility gate)
===============================================================================
The #1 "laughed at" risk: a locked binary that PASSES by DETECTING THE TEST (reads the test
name, embeds golden outputs, switches behavior on test identity) instead of IMPLEMENTING the
tool. One such tool found by a skeptic's grep discredits the entire board. This is distinct
from determinex_copyright_guard (which checks attribution vs registered references); this checks
that the binary EARNS its passes.

It scans each locked tool's SOURCE for gaming signatures and demands every hit be either
JUSTIFIED (recorded in provenance_justifications.json -- e.g. svd2rust-style per-context
routing where the contexts are genuinely distinct and the output is independently correct)
or treated as a RED violation. Surface + require justification = a skeptic's grep finds
nothing we haven't already audited.

Gaming signatures (RED unless justified):
  * reads test identity        PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST, sys.argv scan for test paths, stack-walk to test
  * embeds golden output        include_bytes!/include_str!/embed of golden|expected|snapshot|fixture
  * branches on test name       match/switch/if on a test-name string to choose output
Usage:
  python scripts/determinex_pb_provenance_guard.py            # report
  python scripts/determinex_pb_provenance_guard.py --guard    # exit 1 if any UNJUSTIFIED hit on a lock
