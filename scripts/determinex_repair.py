determinex_repair.py -- the canonical brownfield repair engine
===========================================================
The dual of determinex_build_from_idea: that builds NEW code from a synthesized
oracle; this fixes EXISTING code against its real oracle (its tests/compiler).
Both sit on the same amplifier core -- no second repair engine.

One flow, composing the canonical pieces (nothing reimplemented):

    ingest      determinex_ingest        understand language / oracle / spec
    verify      determinex_oracle        run the real ground truth, collect failures
    adjudicate  determinex_adjudicator   per failure: the move (ROUTE/MATCH/UNBLOCK/...)
    validate    determinex_test_validator is the failing test correct, or slop?
    explain     determinex_explainer     CODE / ENVIRONMENT / TEST + expected/actual/delta
    fix (opt)   determinex_amplified_solve  best-of-K against the SAME oracle

This is what the IDE "Repo Clinic" runs -- the same proven governor + amplifier
as the rest of the system, instead of a separate legacy repair path.

    from determinex_repair import repair_workspace
    r = repair_workspace(Path("repo/"))            # diagnosis only (no model)
    r = repair_workspace(Path("repo/"), generate=model, opt_in=True)  # + amplified fix
