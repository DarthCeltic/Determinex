"""Publish this checkout's source/docs onto the curated release mirror.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`DarthCeltic/Determinex` is a deliberately curated ~46 MB mirror. This dev
checkout is ~10 GB of `.git`, 2,486 commits, and **completely unrelated history**
-- the mirror's `main` commit does not exist in this repository's object store at
all. So `git push origin <branch>` does not do what it looks like it does: it tries
to graft the entire dev history onto the mirror, and GitHub answers `HTTP 500`
(confirmed 2026-07-28, twice, including with `http.postBuffer=500MB`;
`--dry-run` succeeds, so it is the pack, not auth).

There was no tool for this. The mirror had been assembled by hand, which is why
"just push it" kept looking like the obvious move and kept failing.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Copies the allowlisted paths from this checkout onto the mirror's own history as
one ordinary commit, keeping it small, then pushes that.

THE ALLOWLIST IS DERIVED, NOT MAINTAINED
----------------------------------------
It comes from `git ls-tree origin/main` -- the mirror's own published top level.
A hand-kept list would drift from what is actually published, and the drift would
be silent in the direction that matters: a new directory of corpus data or
evidence quietly appearing in a repo that exists to not contain it. Deriving it
means the mirror can only ever receive paths it already publishes; adding a NEW
top-level entry is a deliberate act requiring `--allow-new-path`.

Default is a dry run. Nothing is pushed without `--push`.

#:
#: `corpus` came OFF the NEVER list on 2026-07-31: the corpus is the point of Determinex — the
#: Native Reimplementation Loop feeds real source and a real oracle to a model — so publishing a
#: repo without it ships a hollow product. What cannot travel is the ~150,000 files of VENDORED
#: UPSTREAM SOURCE inside it, for two independent reasons:
#:
#:   SIZE  the pack is 9.73 GiB. GitHub soft-limits at 1 GB and rejects any file over 100 MB.
#:   LAW   those trees are other people's software. Redistribution obliges us to carry each
#:         project's copyright notice and license, and 59 of them still have no license text.
#:
#: So the KNOWLEDGE layer ships — the oracles, our `compile.sh` recipes, eval reports, learned
#: build knowledge, and `canonical_tasks.json`, which pins repository+commit for all 200 tasks —
#: and `determinex corpus fetch` reconstructs any upstream tree from its own maintainers at
#: exactly that commit. Same inputs to the model, nothing re-hosted.

#: 554 MB of raw per-test output on their own, plus 146 MB of `.bak` archives and 72 MB of training
#: corpus. A git repo is the wrong home for that: every revision keeps a copy forever.
#:
#: Verifiability is not lost. `eval_index.json` records `eval_report_sha256` for each row, so the

#: artifact you downloaded is the one the board's number came from.
