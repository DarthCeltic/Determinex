determinex_ingest.py -- The Universal Task Ingester (Adjudicator component A)
==========================================================================
"...take any bench and first run, take it in, understand it, realize it will
need these edits to work or to create this according to what is being asked."

This is the comprehension front of the loop. Pointed at an arbitrary repo or
benchmark task it has never seen, it derives -- deterministically, no LLM -- the
four things the rest of the pipeline needs:

    language     : which language(s) the task is in (extension census)
    build_system : how to build it (cargo / go / cmake / make / npm / gradle / pip)
    harness      : how it is verified (pytest / jest / junit / cargo test / go test)
    oracle       : the ground-truth surface (from determinex_oracle registry); if the
                   task ships NO tests, flag for synthesize_oracle()
    spec         : an inferred behavioral specification -- the asserted behaviors,
                   CLI surface, and invariants reverse-engineered from the tests,
                   so planning is PROACTIVE ("it will need these edits") rather than
                   purely try-fail-inject.

The spec inference is intentionally evidence-based: it extracts the concrete
assertions, invoked argv, and test docstrings already present, rather than
guessing intent. That keeps it honest -- it reports what the tests demand, which
is exactly the ground truth the solve loop must satisfy.
