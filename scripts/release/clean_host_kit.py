"""Assemble a self-contained clean-host verification kit.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`clean_host` is the last gate standing between the release gates and
`release_ready: true`, and it cannot be satisfied from a developer machine by design --
the whole point is a host without the dev environment. Measured 2026-07-29, this box is
Windows 11 **Home**: no Windows Sandbox (Pro/Enterprise only, WindowsSandbox.exe absent),
no Hyper-V, no Windows containers. So the step genuinely requires a second machine.

What should NOT require the operator is assembling the pieces. The smoke script resolves
its manifest and installer relative to a repo root, and validates through the repo's venv
-- none of which exists on a bare VM. This packs everything into one folder with one
entry point, so the operator's whole job is: copy folder, run one command, copy one JSON
back.

Usage::

    python scripts/release/clean_host_kit.py --output .tmp/clean-host-kit
    python scripts/release/clean_host_kit.py --output .tmp/clean-host-kit --zip

Preflight: is this host clean enough to produce release-valid proof?

Run this FIRST. It answers in seconds and changes nothing, so a host that cannot qualify
is discovered before copying a 193 MB installer to it.

The two conditions mirror run_windows_clean_host_install_smoke.ps1 exactly: a clean-host
installer test has to establish that the app installs and runs WITHOUT the developer
environment, so a prior install or a dev toolchain on PATH both disqualify the host.

    order. Measured: the kit shipped the MSI from determinex_download_bundle_20260707 (sha
    5377496523f38b5a) while every release gate and full_release_closure read
    determinex_download_bundle_20260729 by mtime (sha 720cedc10d619ec3).

    current manifest -- so the clean_host gate, the last one standing, could not be satisfied
