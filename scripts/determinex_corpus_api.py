"""determinex_corpus_api.py -- READ-ONLY query surface over corpus/programbench/build_knowledge.json
(prose knowledge) AND corpus/programbench/canonical_tasks.json (structured per-task ground truth).

Every other corpus consumer (_build_knowledge_playbook, the absorber, the flywheel) reads this file
ad hoc with its own bespoke json.loads + key-poking. There has never been a single place a HUMAN (via
the frontend/Learning Studio) or a NEW script could ask the corpus a question. This is that place.

Read-only by design: nothing here writes to build_knowledge.json or canonical_tasks.json. Writers stay
exactly where they already are (determinex_pb_amplified_fix.learn_class, determinex_pb_absorb.absorb,
pb_canonical_tasks.py) -- this module only ever loads and searches.

Sections queried:
  * _topic_index          -- coarse topic -> [{key, summary}] index of the ~70 dated corpus entries
  * class_patterns         -- the proven (detect/symptom/fix[/applies_to/generalized_in]) playbook
  * learned_classes        -- the flywheel: oracle-verified (symptom->fix) distilled from real solves.
                              Quarantined 2026-07-16 (see learned_classes_quarantine_20260716) back to
                              EMPTY; grows ONLY from verified=True entries going forward.
  * top-level dated entries -- every other key in the file (the ~70+ named corpus write-ups)
  * canonical_tasks.json   -- per-task ground truth (repository, pinned commit, language, test counts)
                              for all ~200 ProgramBench tasks, built by pb_canonical_tasks.py from the
                              harness's own task.yaml files. Added 2026-07-16 after a real miss: a
                              provenance check re-derived repository/commit by manually grepping the
                              T: drive instead of querying this already-built index -- see
                              corpus_gap_canonical_tasks_not_queryable_20260716 in build_knowledge.json.
                              A keyed lookup (task_provenance) is used here, not the token-overlap
                              search() below -- this is an exact structured record, not fuzzy prose.
  * general_engineering_playbook -- corpus/general_engineering_playbook.json, a SEPARATE file
                              (not build_knowledge.json). General, non-ProgramBench-specific
                              engineering lessons distilled FROM the PB campaign's class_patterns,
                              stripped of tool-specific framing -- see general_engineering_
                              playbook()'s docstring. Searched only for the default corpus.

    semantic_weight is therefore unchanged; only the quality of the lexical half improves.

    Every non-token-overlap leg is best-effort: if Ollama is unreachable, or SQLite was built
    without FTS5, or the FTS index has not been built, those legs return [] and this degrades to
    exactly search()'s token-overlap ranking. Neither is a hard dependency of the query surface.

    Passing an explicit `corpus` ALSO disables both auxiliary legs, because their indexes are
