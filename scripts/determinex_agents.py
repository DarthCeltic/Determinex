determinex_agents.py -- the agent-CLI sub-agent registry (host any coding agent)
=============================================================================
A PROVIDER is a model: generate(prompt, temperature) -> str.
An AGENT is a whole tool that edits a workspace: Codex CLI, Claude Code, Gemini
CLI, aider, cursor-agent, .... This registry hosts them as SUB-AGENTS: hand one a
task + a workspace, let it do its thing, then -- the part nobody else does --
VERIFY its result through Determinex's oracle. An agent that hallucinates or breaks
the build is caught; only an oracle-passing result is accepted.

That is the whole thesis applied to agents: correctness is bounded by the oracle,
not by trusting the agent. So you can bolt on any agent (present or future) and it
cannot make Determinex wrong -- it can only succeed (verified) or be rejected (with
the failure surfaced to the Adjudicator).

    from determinex_agents import available_agents, run_agent
    res = run_agent("claude-code", task="make the tests pass", workspace=Path("repo/"))
    if res.verified:
        ...   # the agent's edits PASS the oracle

Bringing in a new agent is one register_agent(); it also works through the
extension protocol (a plugin's register(api)).

    ------------------------
    Because it already was two, and they diverged. `_cli_runner` substituted only
    `{task}`/`{model}`; `resolve_argv` also handled `{task_file}`/`{workspace}`
    and dropped empty flag pairs. `local-ollama` is the one agent whose template
    uses `{task_file}`, so every Python-side `run_agent("local-ollama", ...)`
    spawned the CLI with the *literal* string `{task_file}` as a path and died
    with `FileNotFoundError: '{task_file}'` -- while the same agent worked from
    the IDE, because the Rust path goes through `resolve_argv`. Found live
    2026-07-28 by running the local agent on a deliberately-broken workspace.
    A second copy of substitution logic is how that happens; there is now one.

# signal -- whether the agent is actually WORKING right now (rate limits,

# Rust side) is for. Ryan: "I want to see all of the working, not sit there
# and believe it errored out" -- so this stays honest about what it does and

# single afternoon on one machine:
#
#   claude-code   credential present, provider honours it, answered in 5.4s
#   gemini-cli    credential present, no auth method selected -> refused locally, no network call
#   gemini-cli    credential present AND method selected, and the PROVIDER refused the client:
#                 "IneligibleTierError: This client is no longer supported for Gemini Code Assist
#                 for individuals" -- the login is valid, the product access is revoked
#
# One boolean cannot carry that, and the third case is the one that matters most, because it is the
# one no local check can ever discover and the one whose remedy (a different auth method entirely)
# looks nothing like the others. So readiness is a named state, and the states that require a real
