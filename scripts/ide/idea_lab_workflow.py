"""Idea Lab workflow checker.

DETERMINEX_IDEA_LAB_WORKFLOW_LOCK_001 — rung 2.

evaluate(...) takes the runtime state of an Idea Lab session and
returns IDEA_LAB_WORKFLOW_WRITTEN iff the workflow's hard rules
hold:

  * 'Build It' is disabled until support_check_passed is True
    (BLOCKED_MISSING_SUPPORT_CHECK if support check skipped).
  * 'Working' label is disabled until build_verifier_passed AND
    tests_passed AND smoke_passed are all True
    (BLOCKED_FALSE_SUCCESS if any of them False).
  * Unsupported features must be visible
    (BLOCKED_UNSUPPORTED_CLAIM if hidden).
  * External setup caveats must be visible.
  * training_eligible must remain False everywhere.
