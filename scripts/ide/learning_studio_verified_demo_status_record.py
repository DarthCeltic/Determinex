"""Records for DETERMINEX_REACT_LEARNING_STUDIO_VERIFIED_DEMO_STATUS_BINDING_LOCK_001.

Read-only binding to the Codex Learning Studio teaching splash
demo evidence. Exposes a deterministic, JSON-serializable status
the React Learning Studio panel may display.

Hard rules: the record may surface scoped per-fixture teaching
status, beginner / professional / failure explanations, why-the-
verifier-passed grounding, safe next steps, what-this-does-not-
prove, claim boundary, blocked-path summary, source evidence
paths, training False — and MUST NOT broaden that into all-
projects / all-languages / all-users / arbitrary-teaching /
production-ready / autonomous-repair / source-mutation-authorized
/ training-enabled / release-ready / approval-granted claims.

Teaching outputs are NON-AUTHORIZING by construction. Even when
the binding is PASSED, no UI element may imply mutation,
approval, training, or release authorization.
