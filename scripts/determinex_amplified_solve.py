determinex_amplified_solve.py -- the unified Correctness Amplifier loop
====================================================================
Composes all seven amplifier pieces into one call, so ANY model -- however small
-- solves a task correctly or surfaces an honest, proven reason it cannot:

    Ingest (lang/oracle)            determinex_ingest
      -> Decompose to leaves        determinex_decompose      (#2)
         per leaf:
           Context provision        determinex_context        (#4)
           Case retrieval           determinex_case_memory    (#3)
           Output-contract guard    determinex_contract       (#6)
           Verified search          determinex_verified_search(#1)
             with model routing     determinex_router         (#7)
             and progress/loop      determinex_progress       (#5)
      -> on miss: Adjudicate        determinex_adjudicator    (no false surrender)
      -> on solve: admit to memory  determinex_case_memory    (flywheel at inference)

Correctness is bounded by the oracle's soundness (pair with determinex_test_validator),
never by the model's strength. This is the engine behind "any LLM works anything
and is right."

This module is usable two ways:
  * `amplified_solve(...)` -- programmatic, with your own generate/verify callables.
  * as the patch generator inside the hive: wrap the builder model + compiler
    oracle (see `make_hive_solver`).
