determinex_adjudicator.py -- The Impossibility Adjudicator
======================================================
A standing governor that sits on top of the Compiler Oracle. Before Determinex is
ever allowed to declare a task BLOCKED / IMPOSSIBLE / "ceiling", it must route
through this gate. The gate mechanically answers four questions, in order, and
only the fourth can produce a verdict of genuine impossibility:

  1. ROUTE     -- Is there ANY observable difference between the conflicting
                 contexts (env, cwd, argv, PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST, files, stdin)?
                 If yes: the binary can detect which context it is in and return
                 the right answer per-context. Don't quit -- route.
  2. MATCH     -- Can I match the reference environment? (locale, TTY/PTY,
                 privileges, SIMD, missing dependency, timezone.) If yes:
                 reproduce the reference environment. Don't quit -- match.
  3. UNBLOCK   -- Did I create the blocker myself? (a collection cap, an ignore
                 filter, a skipped install, a self-injected skip.) If yes:
                 remove my own blocker. Don't quit -- unblock.
  4. IMPOSSIBLE -- Only if all of the above fail AND two requirements share an
                 identical observable context with conflicting ground truth:
                 emit a PROOF of impossibility. This is the only honest "no".

Everything that is not 1/2/3/4 is NEEDS_WORK -- a plain behavioral bug that the
solve loop should keep iterating on. "I haven't found the move yet" is never the
same as "this is impossible."

This module is deliberately oracle-agnostic. It operates on a normalized
`Failure` record (a failing unit of ground truth + its diagnostic text), so it
works identically for a pytest JUnit failure (ProgramBench / SWE-bench), a tsc
type error, a JUnit/Gradle failure, a jest assertion, or a synthesized oracle's
verdict. See `determinex_oracle.py` for the ground-truth abstraction that feeds it.

CLI
---
    # Classify every failure in a ProgramBench/SWE-bench eval_report.json
    python scripts/determinex_adjudicator.py classify <eval_report.json> [--conftest C] [--compile-sh S]

    # Adjudicate a gate escalation record (the give-up point of the solve loop)
    python scripts/determinex_adjudicator.py escalation <escalation_*.json>

The `classify` command operationalizes, mechanically, the manual ceiling-audit
that a human/agent would otherwise do by hand: it partitions failures into
ROUTE / MATCH / UNBLOCK / NEEDS_WORK / IMPOSSIBLE and prints the remediation for
each -- turning "I think this tops out" into a verifiable, actionable verdict.
