determinex_contract.py -- Output Contract Enforcer (Amplifier piece #6)
====================================================================
The well-formedness floor. Before any candidate reaches the (expensive) oracle,
it must satisfy a cheap, deterministic OUTPUT CONTRACT: is it a valid unified
diff? does the JSON parse? does the code parse in its language? is the required
shape present? A weak model emits malformed junk a large fraction of the time;
rejecting that junk in microseconds -- before a Docker eval or compile -- both
saves the oracle and guarantees a well-formed floor for whatever model plugs in.

This is a pre-filter for VerifiedSearch: wrap a model so malformed candidates are
rejected and resampled, never counted as a real attempt.

# Design (Ryan, 2026-07-16): "it should warn, and if it still goes with it, it should gate
# at compile and be like.. bro i told you not to, its gated try the hell again and actually
# listen this time." -- i.e. NOT a hard reject on first sight (a heuristic pattern match is
# not a sound oracle -- CLAUDE.md: "No LLM judges for code quality — compiler is the only
# oracle"; forcing a genuinely oracle-passing candidate to fail on a heuristic would violate
# that). First occurrence of a trap is a WARNING ONLY and the candidate still reaches the
# real compiler/test oracle untouched. Only if the SAME trap recurs in a LATER candidate
# from the same generation sequence (meaning the model was told and ignored it) does this
# gate BEFORE the candidate ever reaches the oracle -- exactly where native_code_contract
# already sits ("before any candidate reaches the (expensive) oracle").
