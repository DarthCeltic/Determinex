"""scripts/determinex_commit_training_capture.py — capture every commit as a
potential training example, not just Hive DAG build sessions.

Gap found 2026-07-20: scripts/hive/budget.py's queue_for_training() is real
and wired into the general compile-gate loop (not just SWE-bench), but it
only fires for steps executed through determinex_hive.py's DAG pipeline
(StepRecord.compiler_error_hashes, .escalations, etc. -- Hive-specific
fields). logs/retrain_queue.jsonl had been dormant since 2026-04-25 --
almost 3 months -- and structurally could never capture work done outside
that one pipeline (the OSS-integration fixes, the frontend hydration fix,
the hackathon kernel work, the corpus fixes all this session included --
all real, all compiler/test-verified, none of it Hive-DAG-shaped, none of
it captured anywhere).

This captures at COMMIT granularity instead of Hive-step granularity: every
commit's diff + message + a quality tag inferred from the verification
evidence the commit message itself states. This project's own commit
convention already documents test results in the body ("4540/4540 passing",
"0 violations", "N tests ... all pass") -- classify_quality() below reads
that instead of re-running the full suite synchronously in a hook (which
would make every commit slow and block on Docker/Ollama availability).

Usage:
    python scripts/determinex_commit_training_capture.py capture [--sha SHA]
    python scripts/determinex_commit_training_capture.py stats

Writes to logs/commit_training_corpus.jsonl -- deliberately a SEPARATE file
from logs/retrain_queue.jsonl (different schema/granularity; the Hive
step-level queue's consumers expect its exact shape, this must not corrupt
that contract).
