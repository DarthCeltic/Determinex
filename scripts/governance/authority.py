"""
governance.authority -- the anti-overclaim truth anchors
========================================================
The project's institutional memory of what it has NOT yet earned the right to
claim. Consolidated (2026-06-14) from scripts/status/_shared_authority_guards.py
so the same discipline the Correctness Amplifier enforces in code ("no claim
without proof") is enforced for product/release claims too. One canonical home,
guarded by one meta-bench test, instead of 1,175 generated lane tests.

Flip an anchor to True ONLY when it is genuinely, provably earned -- and then the
meta-bench's test_authority_closed will tell you the moment a claim outruns its
proof.
