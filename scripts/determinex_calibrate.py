determinex_calibrate.py — per-rig concurrency calibration for verified search
=============================================================================
Determinex's correctness knob is K: sample K candidates, verify each against a real
oracle, and `P = 1 - (1 - p)^K`. K is therefore not a performance setting -- it is the
rate at which correctness accrues. The right K is a property of the MACHINE, and until
now it was a constant (`k: int = 8`) or an env var, identical on every rig.

Measured, that constant is wrong in both directions:

  AMD Radeon Cloud, vLLM 0.16.1, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B (captured evidence):
      K=1  28.7 tok/s @ 8.92s      K=32 739.9 tok/s @ 10.75s
      K=48 849.7 tok/s @ 13.62s    K=64 512.6 tok/s @ 29.59s   <- collapse
  Consumer box, Ollama, Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B (measured 2026-08-02, warm):
      K=1  17.6 tok/s @ 2.73s      K=6  53.3 tok/s @ 4.62s
      K=8  60.4 tok/s @ 5.66s

The default K=6 leaves ~5x of the Radeon's throughput unused, and is already past the
efficient region on the consumer box. One number cannot serve both.

WHY THIS MEASURES RATHER THAN READS A CONFIG
--------------------------------------------
The first version of this read the backend's declared capacity -- vLLM publishes
`vllm:cache_config_info{num_gpu_blocks, block_size}`, and 31504*16/8192 = 61, which does
predict the Radeon collapse at 64. That looked sufficient until the same approach was tried
on Ollama, where `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1` predicted full serialisation and the machine
delivered 3.4x speedup at K=8 instead. The env var was read from the client shell, not from
the environment the server was launched with, and a client-side config value is not the
authority that enforces the limit.

So: declared capacity is a HINT that seeds the sweep. The measurement is the answer.

OBJECTIVE, v1: CANDIDATES PER SECOND -- AND WHY IT WAS NOT ENOUGH
----------------------------------------------------------------
Aggregate tok/s alone would pick a K that is still "gaining" while wall clock doubles --
useless for verified search, which needs K candidates *and* needs them soon. `K / wall_s` is
the rate at which independent attempts arrive, which is exactly what drives P upward. It
also finds the collapse for free: past the backend's real limit, requests preempt instead of
batching, wall clock explodes, and the ratio falls.

Applied to the captured Radeon numbers this picks K=48 (3.52 cand/s vs 2.98 at K=32 and
2.16 at K=64) -- i.e. it independently reproduces the knee that was found by hand.

Then it was run against a LIVE Radeon MI-series GPU (2026-08-02) rather than a recording,
and the objective broke in two separate ways:

  1. The sweep never found a collapse, because there wasn't one. Candidates/second rose
     monotonically to K=640 (34.17 cand/s) and simply FLATTENED -- 33.26 at K=320, 33.91 at
     448, 34.17 at 640. Doubling K twice bought 2.7%. `max(cand_per_s)` dutifully returned
     640: technically the peak, practically absurd, since it also doubled time-to-first-
     candidate from 9.6s to 18.7s. Collapse is only one of the shapes a ceiling has;
     saturation is another, and this objective is blind to it.

  2. Worse, and the real lesson: on that run the probe task had p = 1.00. The model solved
     it five times out of five, one shot. The calibrator recommended K=16, so verified
     search fired 16 requests and threw 15 of them away. No value of K derived from the
     MACHINE ALONE can be right, because the machine does not know how hard the task is.

OBJECTIVE, v2: EXPECTED TIME TO A VERIFIED SOLUTION
--------------------------------------------------
The thing actually being minimised is wall-clock until the oracle passes something. With
per-attempt success `p` and a measured batch wall time `W(K)`:

    P(batch succeeds) = 1 - (1-p)^K            <- the amplifier's own equation
    E[batches]        = 1 / P
    E[time]           = W(K) / (1 - (1-p)^K)   <- minimise THIS

`W(K)` is a property of the rig and is what the sweep measures. `p` is a property of the
task and is what the solver observes. So a calibration is no longer a number -- it is a
CURVE, and K falls out of the curve once the task's difficulty is known. Against the live
Radeon curve above:

    p = 1.00  ->  K = 1     (one shot works; sampling 16 is pure waste)
    p = 0.50  ->  K = 4
    p = 0.10  ->  K = 32
    p = 0.02  ->  K = 64
    p = 0.005 ->  K = 128

Same GPU, same curve, K spanning 1..128 -- driven entirely by how hard the work is. That is
the correct shape of the knob, and it is why `optimal_k()` now takes `p` and why a caller
that has no estimate of `p` is told so rather than handed a confident constant.

The candidates/second view is retained: it is still exactly right for reporting where the
HARDWARE stops, which is a real and separate fact worth knowing (`detect_ceiling`).

OBJECTIVE, v3: WHAT THE CORPUS SAID BACK
----------------------------------------
The v2 result above was checked against Determinex's own corpus, which already held a
contradicting entry -- `amplification_floor_p_must_exceed_zero`, measured 2026-07-31 with
960 generations on this same GPU and model:

    "Do NOT tune K per task. The K-sweep shows cost is near-flat to K=32 (1.21x wall clock
     for 25.8x tokens), so run large K always: nearly free, and it pays exactly when p is
     mid-range, which is unknowable in advance."

Re-measured on the 2026-08-02 curve: wall clock at K=32 is 1.59x K=1. The corpus is right,
and the v2 framing above overstated its case. The honest comparison:

    p       best K   E[time]   vs K=32        vs K=640 (machine optimum)
    1.00    1        1.6s      1.59x          11.6x
    0.50    4        1.9s      1.33x           9.7x
    0.10    32       2.7s      1.00x           7.0x
    0.02    64       4.7s      1.14x           4.0x

Against a sensible fixed K=32 the p-aware win is 1.0-1.6x, not the 11.6x that comparing
against K=640 suggested. K=640 was never a real baseline -- it was this module's OWN
machine-optimum rule, so the large speedup measured the v1 defect, not the v2 benefit.

What survives, and is the actual contribution:

  * `max(cand_per_s)` is the wrong way to say "run large K". It returns K=640 here, costing
    11.6x the latency of K=1 for 2.7% more throughput than K=320. "Nearly free" is a claim
    about LATENCY, so `free_k()` defines it that way -- and independently returns K=32,
    reproducing the corpus's separately-chosen figure.
  * With p KNOWN (case memory, a completed first batch, a measured sweep), tuning is a real
    but modest additional win, and at p=1.00 it correctly stops sampling 16 candidates for a
    task one shot solves.
  * The ceiling-shape, jitter, sweep-abort and degraded-point fixes stand independently of
    any of this.

So: `optimal_k(..., p=None)` returns the nearly-free K, not the machine optimum. Tune only
when p is actually known.

    1. A failed request must not abort the sweep. At K=640 through an frp tunnel the

       `ex.map`, killed a 12-point sweep, and the whole run printed NOTHING -- eleven
       measured points, all discarded, because the twelfth had a bad link. Failures are now
       counted per point.

    2. Counting them is not the same as ignoring them. A wall time that includes requests
       that never completed is not a throughput measurement, so `KPoint.usable` excludes a
       point where more than 10% failed rather than averaging the damage in. Silently
       treating a degraded point as data is the same shape as an oracle that passes because
       it could not run.

    `on_point` streams each result as it is measured, so a sweep that dies at K=640 still
    leaves the operator everything up to K=448.

    A backend can stop rewarding concurrency in two quite different ways, and conflating

      collapse    throughput FALLS. vLLM past its KV budget preempts instead of batching:
                  captured Radeon run, 849.7 tok/s at K=48 -> 512.6 at K=64 while wall
                  clock went 13.6s -> 29.6s. Unambiguous, and `pick_optimal` finds it.

      saturation  throughput FLATTENS. Live Radeon run: 33.26 cand/s at K=320, 34.17 at
                  K=640 -- doubling K twice for 2.7%, while time-to-first-candidate went
                  9.6s -> 18.7s. Nothing fell, so collapse detection reported "no ceiling,
                  this rig has more headroom" and `max(cand_per_s)` recommended K=640. Both
                  statements were true and the recommendation was still wrong.

    Saturation is the SMALLEST K that already reaches `saturation_frac` of the best
    candidate rate the sweep ever saw -- i.e. the cheapest K you could have stopped at.

    WHY NOT A LOCAL GRADIENT. The first version compared each K to the next and declared
    saturation at the first step whose per-doubling gain fell under 15%. Run live against a
    Radeon MI GPU with `--repeats 1` it answered "saturation at K=16" on a curve that went
    on to DOUBLE (8.5 cand/s at K=32 -> 18.8 at K=64 -> 32.8 at K=448). One noisy point --
    K=32 measured 3.744s, slower than K=64's 3.413s, which is plainly jitter and not
    physics -- was enough, because a local gradient asks a question about two samples and
    a ceiling is a claim about the whole curve. A fraction-of-peak rule cannot be fooled by
    a single slow sample: the sample would have to BE the peak.

    Returning the largest swept K means the sweep never saturated within its range, which

    THE MODEL, and why it has a second term.

    Determinex's verified search generates its K candidates CONCURRENTLY -- that is the
    W(K) this module sweeps -- and then verifies them ONE AT A TIME, breaking at the first
    candidate the oracle passes (`for i, (...) in enumerate(batch): res = self.verify(...)`
    in determinex_verified_search). On the 2026-08-02 field proof against a Docker-backed
    Compiler Oracle the per-sample log line read `gen 12s verify 10s`, so at K=8 that is
    ~12s of parallel generation against up to 80s of serial verification. Modelling it:

        E[verifications per round] = sum_{i=1..K} (1-p)^(i-1) = (1 - (1-p)^K) / p
        E[round wall]              = W_gen(K) + verify_s * E[verifications]
        P(round succeeds)          = 1 - (1-p)^K
        E[total]                   = E[round wall] / P
                                   = W_gen(K)/P  +  verify_s / p

    THE SECOND TERM DOES NOT DEPEND ON K, and that is the useful result rather than a
    caveat. Expected verifications to the first success is 1/p however you batch them --
    candidates are checked one at a time until one passes, so grouping them into rounds of
    K changes when they happen, not how many happen. A slow serial oracle therefore makes
    every K worse by the same additive constant and leaves the ARGMIN untouched.

    So the K recommendations here are unaffected by oracle cost, which is worth knowing
    precisely because the intuition ("a slow oracle means sample fewer") is wrong. What the
    term buys is an honest ESTIMATE: at p=0.02 with a 10s Docker oracle the true expected
    time is ~505s, not the ~5s that generation throughput alone suggests, and a user
    planning a run deserves the real number.

    `verify_s = 0` recovers the generation-only model for a caller whose oracle is a cheap
    in-process assertion.

    Re-checked against the 2026-08-02 live curve, that is correct: wall clock at K=32 is
    1.59x K=1. Sampling 32 candidates instead of 1 costs about half again the wall clock and
    converts a p=0.1 task from 10% to 97%. Under uncertainty that trade is overwhelming, and
    `optimal_k_for(p)` should not be reached for a task whose difficulty nobody has measured.

    What the live run DID establish is that the machine optimum -- `max(cand_per_s)`, which
    returned K=640 -- is not the way to express "run large K". K=640 costs 11.6x the wall
