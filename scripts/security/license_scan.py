    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-30). `paths` defaulted to `[ROOT]`, and `scan()` calls `detect()`
    once per element -- so the inventory had exactly ONE row: the repository root, whose licence
    is our own AGPL. `security_gate` then explicitly exempts that row, which left `real_blocks`
    permanently empty. A gate named "license_scan", underwriting `license_inventory_reviewed:
    true` in the legal packet for an AGPL release, had therefore never examined a single
    dependency and could only fail if our own LICENSE stopped being AGPL.

    Python distributions expose their licence in `*.dist-info` (LICENSE file and/or METADATA);
    npm packages in their own directory. Both are directories `detect()` already understands.
    Direct npm dependencies only -- the full transitive tree is tens of thousands of directories
    and belongs to a dedicated SBOM tool, not to a gate that has to finish.
