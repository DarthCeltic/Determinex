"""
Lockfile verifier — confirms Python requirements files use pinned, hash-verified installs.

Checks:
  1. All direct dependencies are pinned (==, not >=, ~=, ^)
  2. No dependency has a known-bad version pattern
  3. Hash-checking mode supported (--require-hashes compatible)
  4. No unpinned VCS dependencies (git+https:// without @commit)

Reports violations as a structured list. Fails (exit 1) if any CRITICAL violations found.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    Found 2026-07-30. `uv.lock` pinned **7 packages below their declared floors**, and most of those
    floors exist to close specific advisories:

        aiohttp      3.13.5 < 3.14.1   (11 CVEs incl. CVE-2026-54273..80)
        cryptography 48.0.0 < 48.0.1   (GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf)
        torch        2.12.0 < 2.13.0   (CVE-2025-3000 memory corruption + PYSEC-2025-194)
        pyasn1       0.6.3  < 0.6.4    (PYSEC-2026-3455/6/7)
        pillow, setuptools, httplib2

    Two sources of truth for the same versions, with nothing comparing them, and the
    security-relevant one silently losing. CI installs with `pip install -r requirements.txt` so it
    gets the fixed versions -- but `[tool.uv.workspace]` is configured, so the documented `uv sync`
    workflow resolves from `uv.lock` and would quietly install the vulnerable set.

    HIGH, not MEDIUM: `passed` is `critical_count == 0 and high_count == 0`, and a lock that
    reintroduces a fixed CVE should stop the gate rather than be noted in passing. Contrast with the
    unpinned-specifier findings, which are advisory precisely because a `>=` floor is a deliberate
    choice -- converting these to `==` would freeze the floors and prevent future fixes arriving.
