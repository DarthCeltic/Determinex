"""
Installed-vs-declared verifier — does this environment actually satisfy requirements?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-07-28 a real pip-audit run found 42 HIGH CVEs across 7 packages. Every one
of the fixes was ALREADY DECLARED in requirements.txt -- `aiohttp>=3.14.1`,
`cryptography>=48.0.1`, `pillow>=12.3.0`, `setuptools>=83.0.0`, each with the CVE id
in a trailing comment -- while the venv still held aiohttp 3.13.5, cryptography
48.0.0, pillow 12.2.0 and setuptools 81.0.0. The floors had been written and never
installed.

Worse, the one tool that would have caught it was itself only declared:
`pip-audit>=2.7.0` sat in requirements.txt while `pip_audit` was absent from the
venv, so `dependency_scan.py` reported "No scanner available" and the security gate
was blocked on a scan that could not run. Nothing anywhere compared what was
DECLARED against what was INSTALLED.

`verify_lockfiles.py` is the neighbouring check and does not cover this: it inspects
the requirement FILES (pinning style, known-bad patterns, unpinned VCS refs) and
never looks at the environment. A declared floor that is not installed is a fiction,
and this module is what makes that fiction fail loudly.

SEVERITY
--------
CRITICAL when the requirement line mentions a CVE / PYSEC / GHSA id, because that is
a security floor and an unapplied security floor is the exact failure above.
Otherwise HIGH for a version below the floor, and MEDIUM for a declared package that
is not installed at all (which may be an optional extra).

Usage::

    python scripts/security/verify_installed.py
    python scripts/security/verify_installed.py --json
    python scripts/security/verify_installed.py --strict   # exit 1 on CRITICAL
