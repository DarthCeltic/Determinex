secret_scan.py -- find leaked API keys / secrets in the working tree and history
================================================================================
Defensive security for YOUR machine, independent of any product claim. Scans for
provider-key shapes (Anthropic / Google / OpenAI / DeepSeek / generic) so a live
secret never sits in a tracked file or in pushed git history.

    python scripts/security/secret_scan.py            # scan tracked working tree
    python scripts/security/secret_scan.py --history  # also scan ALL git history
    python scripts/security/secret_scan.py --pushed   # only what the REMOTE has

Prints REDACTED matches (first/last few chars) and a clear verdict. Exit 1 if any
secret is found in a place that could leak (tracked file, or pushed history).
