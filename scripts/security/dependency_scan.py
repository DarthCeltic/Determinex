"""
Dependency vulnerability scanner.

Uses pip-audit (preferred) or safety as fallback to check installed Python
packages against known CVE databases.

Severity classification:
  CRITICAL / HIGH   → fail (block) unless explicitly waived
  MEDIUM            → warn, require acknowledgment
  LOW               → log only

    `_persist_best`: a starved or failed re-run must not clobber a good result.

    The previous findings are kept, `blocked` is forced true (a stale record must
    never read as current clearance -- if the old scan was clean, "clean 5 days
    ago and unscannable now" is not a pass), and the failed attempt is recorded
