"""Determinex I/O-example extractor.

Turns a tool's shipped pytest suite into concrete black-box examples:
    {test, argv, stdin, env, expect_rc, expect_stdout (exact), expect_in[...]}
by AST-parsing each test function for its run-helper invocation and assertions,
and resolving golden-file references (`(RESOURCES / "x.golden").read_text()`)
against the actual golden files on disk. These examples are ground truth -- the
local oracle (determinex_local_oracle) runs the reimpl against them with zero
network and no Docker, so a fix is validated in milliseconds before any eval.

It is deliberately CONSERVATIVE: an example is emitted only when argv is
recoverable AND at least one expectation (rc / exact stdout / contains) is
known. Anything ambiguous is skipped and counted -- never a guessed expectation,
so the oracle never reports false confidence.

PB-compliant: read-only over the shipped tests. It never edits a test, a golden,
collection, or the eval.

    _extract_kwarg_flag_map found being .extend()-ed per-keyword) and resolve each
    element via extra_vars, or the 'executable' placeholder convention for a path
    expression ending in that literal component. The executable-path expression is often
    one indirection away (`executable = WORKSPACE_ROOT / "executable"` on an earlier

    inline at the list-literal site -- resolved here by scanning target's own local
    assignments for the SAME bare-Name-to-path-expression shape before falling through to
    a direct check. Returns None (never guesses) the moment any element can't be resolved
    this way.

    Sized: 3 of the top-4 remaining-skip tools (gomplate, bedtools2, esubaalew__run) all

    ALIAS for an already-known runner under the fixture's own name, e.g. (found in xh's

        def run_xh(*args, ...): ...subprocess.run(['./executable', *args])...  # real impl

    A test taking `xh` as a parameter then calls it directly (`xh('--print=B', ...)`).
    `_discover_wrapper_names`/`_shells_out` only look for a direct subprocess/known-runner
    CALL inside a function body -- a bare `return <name>` has no Call node to match, so
    "xh" was never added to extra_run_names even though "run_xh" was (from the plain
    function def). Resolves one hop of simple module-level `alias = name` assignment
    (`_run_xh_func = run_xh`) so the fixture's returned name reaches a known runner, then
    registers the FIXTURE's own name as an additional alias. Same file + sibling helper
    modules as _discover_wrapper_names; never guesses past one assignment hop.

    Returns alias name -> its REAL target name (2026-07-17, dropbear's whole test
    suite: `def run_cmd(): return run_binary` where run_binary is a well-learned
    wrapper with a real base/flags/suffix contract) -- previously only a bare set of
    alias NAMES, discarding which target each aliases. Without the target, callers
    could mark "run_cmd" as a VALID run-name (so _find_run_call doesn't skip its call
    nodes) but had no way to propagate run_binary's actual LEARNED base contract to
    run_cmd's own name in kwarg_flags -- is_learned_wrapper stayed False at every
    run_cmd(...) call site, so the caller's own args became the WHOLE argv, missing

# Custom assertion-helper resolution (2026-07-16)

# Same principle as wrapper-name auto-discovery, applied to the OTHER half of a test: many
# real suites factor repeated assertion shapes into a helper (`assert_err(proc, rc, subs)`)
# instead of inlining `assert proc.returncode == rc` + a loop of `assert s in proc.stderr`.
# _find_expectations only recognized inline ast.Compare assertions -- a call to such a helper
# is an ast.Call, invisible to it entirely. Fixed by statically analyzing the helper's OWN
# body once (which of its parameters plays the "expected rc" role, which plays the "list of
# required substrings" role), then, at each call site, resolving the actual arguments passed
# for those parameter positions the same way an inline assertion's constants are resolved.
