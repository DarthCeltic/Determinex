"""determinex_platform_screen.py -- refuse cross-platform data hazards before they
become capability verdicts.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
In one night, on one machine, these seven hazards each produced a WRONG ANSWER rather
than an error. Two of them printed a perfect zero that was indistinguishable from
"the model cannot do this":

  1. CRLF in a file executed by /bin/sh      -> "Syntax error: word unexpected"
  2. a Windows path passed to a Linux shell  -> "C:DevRadeon...: command not found"
  3. MSYS path conversion of a container arg -> "working directory 'W:/' is invalid"
  4. exec bit lost crossing a tar/host bound -> 0/234, looked like total model failure
  5. host binary graded vs in-container truth-> 0/234, looked like total model failure
  6. env var colliding with an OS-reserved   -> float('<repo>/0.6')
     name (TEMP on Windows)
  7. non-UTF-8 bytes in captured output      -> mojibake in every log line

The through-line is the same one this codebase keeps relearning: a silent wrong answer
is worse than a loud failure, and "0/N" must never be reportable until the transport
has been cleared. These checks are cheap; run them at the boundary, not after.
