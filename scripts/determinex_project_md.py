"""determinex_project_md.py -- generate the per-project instructions file every LLM/agent tool
reads first (Claude Code's CLAUDE.md, Gemini CLI's GEMINI.md, OpenAI Codex's AGENTS.md, Cursor's
.cursorrules, ...), for every project Determinex builds or opens.

Ryan's direct instruction (2026-07-27): "The projects no matter the llms, should all default to
the project md... its where all llms go for context, layout, marching orders, etc... You should
know what the perfect project md looks like, what questions should auto ask based on the initial
information, and sub clarifying information."

Design, three pieces:

1. ONE canonical file, AGENTS.md -- the emerging cross-tool convention (OpenAI Codex CLI and a
   growing set of other agentic tools read it natively), and already this exact repo's own
   pattern for frontend/ (frontend/AGENTS.md holds the real content; frontend/CLAUDE.md is one
   line: "@AGENTS.md"). Every fact in it is DERIVED, not invented -- from determinex_ingest.py's
   TaskUnderstanding (language/build_system/harness/oracle, already-inferred no-LLM) plus the
   build spec (Goal/Language/Constraints/Files) already produced by spec_generator.py. This
   module adds no new inference step for facts ingest() can already answer; it only formats them.

2. Tool-specific files. CLAUDE.md is written as `@AGENTS.md` -- verified live in THIS session
   (this repo's own frontend/CLAUDE.md resolves that way through the harness reading it right
   now) -- so it is a one-line pointer, not a duplicate. Every other tool file (GEMINI.md,
   .cursorrules, CODEX.md) is a FULL copy of the same content: import-syntax support for those
   tools is not verified, and a silent no-op pointer would be worse than a duplicated-but-working
   file. Existing files are NEVER overwritten -- write_project_md_files() skips any target that
   already exists, so a user's own hand-written instructions are never clobbered.

3. infer_project_convention_questions() -- the "auto ask, sub-clarify" half. Everything ingest()
   can derive (language, build/test commands, existing behaviors) is filled in with NO question
   asked. Only the small set of conventions that are genuinely NOT inferable from source/spec
   alone -- API surface shape, lint strictness, testing philosophy -- become explicit questions,
   each carrying a `why_it_matters` so a caller (the setup wizard, idea_oracle's conversation)
   can show the user why it's asking rather than just a bare prompt. This deliberately does NOT
   reimplement idea_oracle.py's LLM-driven discovery conversation (audit-before-build: that
   already exists and works) -- it is a small, separate, purely-deterministic supplement scoped
   to project-md conventions specifically.

    python scripts/determinex_project_md.py generate <project_root> [--answers answers.json]
    python scripts/determinex_project_md.py questions <project_root>
