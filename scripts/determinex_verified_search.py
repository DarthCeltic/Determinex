determinex_verified_search.py -- The Correctness Amplifier (keystone)
==================================================================
"...any LLM, regardless of how good or large or small, can access this system
and work anything, and it be right."

This is the layer that makes that literally true. The Oracle + Adjudicator +
Validator make a STRONG model honest. This makes a WEAK model CORRECT.

The mechanism is not magic, it is arithmetic. A model's per-attempt success on a
step is some probability p. If the answer can be VERIFIED deterministically (and
it can -- that is the Compiler/Universal Oracle), then sampling K diverse
candidates and keeping the one that passes gives system success:

        P(solve) = 1 - (1 - p)^K

    p=0.10, K=30  -> 0.958      p=0.20, K=15 -> 0.965      p=0.05, K=60 -> 0.954

So ANY model with p > 0 is converted toward correctness by verified search. Make
each step small enough (the Decomposer) that p is workable, sample against the
oracle, keep what passes. That is how a 1.5B model -- or a model you have never
heard of -- "works anything and is right."

THE SOUNDNESS CONTRACT (load-bearing): this only yields *correct* output if the
oracle is *sound*. A wrong test makes verified search converge confidently to a
wrong answer. Therefore every oracle passed in here SHOULD be paired with the
Test Validator -- garbage oracle in, confident garbage out. This module refuses
to claim "solved" without a passing OracleResult, and records the proof.

Model-agnostic by construction
------------------------------
The model is just a callable `generate(prompt: str, temperature: float) -> str`.
Local 1.5B, cloud frontier, cloaked, an ensemble -- all plug in identically.
The oracle is just `verify(candidate: str) -> OracleResult`. Nothing here knows
or cares which model produced the candidate. That IS the "any LLM can access
this system" interface.
