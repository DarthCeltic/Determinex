"""A local model call must carry a timeout, or the build session hangs forever.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Found 2026-07-30 by watching a `run-session` sit on step 2 for 30+ minutes: **0% CPU** and two
ESTABLISHED sockets to `127.0.0.1:11434`, having written its builder output and then stopped. It was
blocked on an Ollama read that never returned, with nothing to interrupt it.

`api_client.ApiRateLimiter.call` has an OOM guard whose comment says exactly what must not happen --
*"Local Ollama calls can stall forever ... Without a timeout the step hangs forever."* But the
condition was:

    _model = kwargs.get("model", "")
    if isinstance(_model, str) and _model.startswith("ollama/"):

and `kwargs["model"]` holds the **configured alias**, not the resolved provider name.
`builder_model` comes straight from `model_assignments["builder"]`, i.e. `determinex/engineer`, which
does not start with `ollama/`. So no timeout reached the builder, monitor, oracle or architect calls
and the documented failure was the actual behaviour.

THE SAME BUG, THREE TIMES
-------------------------
`budget.is_local_model` exists *because* the pricing path had this identical defect, fixed
2026-07-29: the check was `startswith("ollama/") or startswith("determinex/")`, and the default role
assignments are BARE tags (`determinex-engineer-v11-dsl` starts with `determinex-`, not
`determinex/`), so every local call was billed at the cloud fallback rate and eventually tripped
`budget_exhausted` on a session that had never left the machine. That docstring even notes the same
defect remained in api_client.

So the rule this file enforces is not "check these prefixes" but **"use the one canonical locality
helper"** -- a fourth hand-rolled prefix test is how this recurs.
