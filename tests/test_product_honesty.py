This project's entire value proposition is that it does not overstate what it has proven, so a
surface that asserts an unverified fact is a product defect, not a cosmetic one. Every check below
corresponds to a claim this app really made.

Source-level checks on purpose. These are cheap, they run in the Python suite alongside the release
gates, and the failure mode they guard against is a *string* being rendered unconditionally --
which is exactly what source text shows and what a mounted-component test tends to miss.
