"""
Tests for scripts/pb_tier_classify.py's reconcile_from_archive() — the
archive-authoritative provenance law.

Regression coverage for the bug found 2026-07-02 during a corpus-center
audit: PROMOTE treated "in verified_locks.json" (score-verified: cache-
cleared eval, passed==total, tarball sha pinned — per that file's own
note) as sufficient grounds to force a row to strict_lock, without
checking whether the row's CURRENT status was a deliberate provenance
hold (needs_reverify). Three real corpus rows (chmln__handlr,
isona__dirble, ngrrram) are score-perfect and score-verified but were
explicitly parked at needs_reverify by the 2026-06-30 provenance audit
because their reimplementation-vs-upstream-copy status couldn't be
confirmed. Auto-promoting them would have silently re-introduced the
exact overclaiming that audit corrected.
