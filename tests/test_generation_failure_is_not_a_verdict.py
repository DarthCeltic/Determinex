"""A model that was never reached must not be reported as a model that failed.

MEASURED 2026-07-31. Running the flagship greenfield path exactly as its own `--help` documents:

    determinex_build_from_idea.py --idea reverse_words.md --provider local \
        --model determinex-engineer-v11-dsl:latest --k 6

    result: not solved  samples=12
    proof: no program passed the 4 checks (12 samples).
    next moves: ['behavioral:semantic']

Nothing about that output is true. LiteLLM had raised `BadRequestError: LLM Provider NOT
provided` on all twelve calls, because a bare Ollama tag -- the tag exactly as `ollama list`
prints it -- reached the LiteLLM lane without its `ollama/` prefix. No model produced a single
candidate. The run nevertheless reported a correctness verdict, and the Adjudicator offered a
next move ("behavioral:semantic") derived from failures that did not exist, pointing the reader
at prompt tuning when the fix was a provider setting.

Two separate defects, and both are guarded here:

1. `VerifiedSearch.solve` turned a generator exception into the *string*
   `"__generation_error__: ..."`, which was then digested, deduped and handed to the oracle as
   if it were source code. Because every error string hashed identically, round 2 saw zero
   distinct candidates and diagnosed "model is looping" -- an actively wrong root cause.
2. `get_generator("local", "<bare tag>")` built a generator that raised on every call, rather
   than qualifying a name whose provider the caller had already declared.

After the fix the same command solves on sample 1.
