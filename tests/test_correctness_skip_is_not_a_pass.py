"""A correctness suite that never ran must not be recorded as a pass.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`run_correctness_tests` signals "the tests did not run" by returning `(True, <signal>)` for five
distinct conditions. Both call sites in `hive/executor.py` tested the boolean FIRST:

    if _ct_passed:                      # matched -- every skip signal returns True
        step.correctness_result = "pass"
    elif _ct_output in _skip_signals:    # unreachable
        step.correctness_result = "skipped"

So a step whose tests never executed was recorded as `correctness_result="pass"`, which then fed two
consumers as a verification that had not happened:

  * `executor.py` `_tests_passed` -> credits the gamma channel of the adjudication score and sets
    `tests_exist=True`, changing the weighting;
  * `dspy_modules._load_trainset_from_sessions` -> `compiler_result="PASS"`, `score=1.0`.

The triggering conditions are ordinary: the Architect declared a harness path the Builder never
wrote; the language is not rust/go/python (TypeScript included -- and validate_project now genuinely
verifies TypeScript, so a whole TS session recorded every step's tests as passing); the run timed
out; the runner binary was missing.

The tuple being matched was also incomplete and used equality: `harness_read_error` was absent
entirely, and both `harness_read_error: {e}` and `runner_not_found: {e}` append an exception message,
so exact membership could never have matched them even had the branch been reachable.
