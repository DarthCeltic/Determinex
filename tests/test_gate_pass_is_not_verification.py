"""A compile gate PASS is not proof a compiler ran, and only proof may enter the corpus.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Found 2026-07-30 (S2.5). `_compile_gate` returned `(True, "")` -- indistinguishable from a real
compile pass -- in every one of these cases:

  * the baseline compile failed, so the patch was applied but never compiled
  * `_run_compile_check` hit FileNotFoundError, i.e. cargo/go/mvn is not installed
  * the language was unsupported, or had no pom/gradle/tsconfig/CMakeLists/Makefile
  * any exception at all

The cause was a sentinel collision: `_run_compile_check` returned a bare string where `""` meant
BOTH "compiled clean" and "could not check". Seven paths returned `""` without compiling.

That PASS is what caused `capture_successful_epoch` to write `"verified": true` into
auto_curriculum.jsonl -- a file whose whole purpose is LoRA training data, and which CLAUDE.md
says holds only samples that have "passed a real compiler". So on a host missing a toolchain,
every patch was captured as verified and taught to the next model. The function's own docstring
claimed "Called only when: targeted tests PASS AND regression sweep PASSES", which was false.

This is the same defect shape as the correctness-skip bug fixed in the same session: a value that
means "not checked" being truthy where "checked and fine" was expected. Both are guarded now
because the shape recurs.
