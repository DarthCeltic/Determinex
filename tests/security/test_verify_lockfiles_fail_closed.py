"""An unreadable requirements file is not a clean requirements file.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`verify_lockfiles.check_file` opened each requirements file inside a broad `try` and returned `[]` on
any failure. `[]` means "no violations", so a file that could not be read contributed **zero** to
`critical_count` and `high_count` -- and `passed` is `critical_count == 0 and high_count == 0`. So the
gate reported a pass for a file it had never inspected.

This is the same defect as S0.2 in `secret_scan` ("a failed scan read as a clean scan"), in a
different gate, found 2026-07-30 by scanning for broad exception handlers that return a success-ish
value. The pattern is worth naming because it keeps recurring here: the failure path and the
everything-is-fine path being represented by the same value.

Note the contrast with `dependency_scan._load_waivers`, which also returns `[]` on error and is
CORRECT to do so: empty waivers means nothing is excused, which is stricter rather than laxer. The
test for "does a broad handler matter?" is always "does the returned value read as pass or as fail?".
