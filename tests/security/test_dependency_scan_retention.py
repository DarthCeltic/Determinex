"""A dependency scan that could not run must not erase one that did.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Found by diffing an uncommitted working-tree change on 2026-07-28. The artifact
`assurance/security/dependency_scan.json` had recorded a real run on 2026-07-23 --
383 packages, 5 HIGH CVEs, each enumerated. A later run on a machine whose venv
has no `pip_audit` module replaced the whole thing with zeros and an empty
vulnerability list.

The blocking decision itself was already correct: `ScanReport.blocked` returns
True whenever `scan_error` is set, with a comment recording that exact
false-confidence bug. So it was not a silent PASS. But the *evidence* of 5 known
HIGH vulnerabilities was destroyed by a run that scanned nothing, and the artifact
gave no clue why every count had gone to zero -- `scan_error` was not serialised.

The protection mirrors the ProgramBench eval path's `_persist_best`: a starved or
failed re-run never clobbers a good result.
