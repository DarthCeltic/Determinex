"""Tests for determinex_io_extractor.py's f-string file-staging support (2026-07-17),
the twelfth fix in the skip-rate chain.

Continuing the tool-by-tool audit onto xh's remaining skips, sampled a broad, non-network
spread and found test_data_binary_from_file entirely unresolved:

    test_file = RESOURCES / 'binary_test.txt'
    RESOURCES.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    test_file.write_text('binary content\\n')
    result = run(['--curl', 'http://httpbin.org/post', f'@{test_file}'])
    assert result.returncode == 0
    assert "--data-binary" in stdout
    assert f"@{test_file}" in stdout

_track_files already resolves `test_file = RESOURCES / 'x'; test_file.write_text(...)`
into files_map (this pattern was already supported, confirmed by reading the existing
code before assuming anything was missing -- audit-before-build). The gap was purely on
the CONSUMPTION side: _file_arg (the function that recognizes a tracked file variable
used as an argv element and stages it) only matched `str(v)` or a bare `v` -- an f-string
reference (`f'@{test_file}'`) was invisible to it, so the file variable's resolved content
never got staged even though it was already known.

The generic _resolve() f-string branch (added in fix 11) COULD have resolved the text
`'@binary_test.txt'` on its own, but that path only produces a string -- it does not know
to also stage the underlying file for the oracle. Extracting the argv text alone without
staging the file would produce a CONFIDENTLY WRONG example: the oracle would run the real
CLI against a file that doesn't exist. That is worse than not extracting the test at all,
so this was deliberately NOT built via the cheaper _resolve() path (flagged, sized, and
correctly deferred as `io_extractor_write_text_staged_file_lead_20260717` in
build_knowledge.json rather than rushed).

Fix: extended _file_arg itself to also recognize a JoinedStr (f-string) argv element that
wraps EXACTLY ONE tracked file variable (plus arbitrary literal text around it, like the
leading `@`), and changed its return shape from a 2-tuple (basename doubling as both the
staged filename AND the argv text) to a 3-tuple `(arg_text, basename, content)`, since for
the f-string case those first two now differ (arg_text='@binary_test.txt', basename=
'binary_test.txt'). Both existing call sites (_resolve_list, _find_run_call's positional
arg loop) updated to unpack the 3-tuple and stage under `basename` while emitting
`arg_text` into argv -- this keeps the plain `str(v)`/bare-`v` cases byte-identical (there
arg_text == basename already). Also merged files_map's basenames into vars_map (as plain
strings) so the SAME variable resolves for an f-string reference on the ASSERTION side
too (`assert f"@{test_file}" in stdout`), via the existing fix-11 vars_map lookup in
_resolve_in_snippet -- no new logic needed there, just wider data flow.

Real A/B counterfactual: xh's test_curl_conversion.py went from partially-resolved to
163/163 (0 skipped) on this measure. Across xh's whole directory (one branch): 529->536
examples (+7 -- most of xh's remaining skips are still the separate, genuinely unfixable
http_server network-mock-server category, and the tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile-random-path
category, neither touched by this fix). Full 6-tool re-scan: xh 541->549 examples,
skip rate 46.5%->45.8%. Other 5 tools unchanged (pattern not present in their sampled
branches).
