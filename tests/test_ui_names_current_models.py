"""Does the UI name the models the system actually runs?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Two instances in one day, 2026-07-29:

  * /proof-center credited the SHIPPED models (v11/v6/v5) with the scores earned by their
    predecessors (v10/v5/v3), and showed 87% for a Sentinel version that has no eval
    artifact at all.
  * MatrixExecutionDisplay.tsx labelled the three MoA agents
    determinex-sentinel-v3 / engineer-v10-dsl / observer-v5-dsl -- an entire generation
    behind what scripts/hive/ctx_config.py assigns.

Neither was caught by anything, because a model tag is a string: TypeScript cannot tell a
current tag from a superseded one, and the UI renders whichever it was given.

The source of truth here is `scripts/models/model_router.CURRENT_MODEL_IDS`, imported
rather than restated -- a copied list is exactly what drifted in the first place.

WHY THERE IS AN ALLOWLIST. Some UI files must name superseded models on purpose:
LocalModelSettingsPanel mirrors STALE_MODEL_IDS so it can WARN about them, and
work-readiness maps aliases including historical ones. Naming a stale model is only a bug
when the UI presents it as the model in use, so those files are listed explicitly instead
of being silently skipped by a pattern.
