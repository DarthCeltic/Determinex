"""Tests for scripts/determinex_pb_absorb.py's quality gate and merge-on-write safety.

The merge-on-write test reproduces the exact 2026-07-19 data-loss bug: a long-running absorb
pass holds build_knowledge.json in memory for its whole runtime; a naive flush blindly
overwrites the file, silently erasing anything another writer added in the meantime. Two real
corpus findings were lost this way in the same session that fixed it.
