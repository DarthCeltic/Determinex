"""Addon reachability lock -- ADDON_REACHABILITY_LOCK_001.

Ryan, live, 2026-07-23, after this exact bug pattern surfaced for the
FIFTH time across separate audit rounds: "im tired of issues that keep
surfacing... go through and find all instances of those patterns from
the backend... the corpus should theoretically be able to see all of
this, or it should have if you have built it and wired it right."

The pattern, every time: a real, backend-wired, often lock-verified addon
panel (Idea Lab; FlywheelFeed/PrivacyCockpit/ArtifactBrowser; Learning
Studio/Repo Clinic/Maintenance Bay/Product Surfaces; Mission/Roadmap/
Flywheel/Runtime/Merge) gets registered in `addonItems` and the command
palette, and NOTHING ELSE -- reachable only via Ctrl+K or the addon-dock's
own AddonSwitcher dropdown, which itself only renders once some OTHER
addon is already open. A normal user clicking around the UI has no path
to it at all.

A markdown lesson (however honest) doesn't stop this from recurring --
the corpus has no way to "see" a frontend UI-wiring gap unless something
actually checks for it on every change. This is that something: every
`addonItems` id must appear in `quickAttachIds`, the ONE status-bar
surface page.tsx's own comment already describes as "reachable from
every screen, not just Work/Explorer's inline grids" -- one absolute
rule, no addon-by-addon judgment calls about whether some other screen's
bespoke button counts as "discoverable enough."

Static text-based (matches this repo's existing tests/ide_frontend/*.py
convention, e.g. test_frontend_panel_command_wiring_lock.py) -- no build
step, no runtime, just page.tsx's own source.
