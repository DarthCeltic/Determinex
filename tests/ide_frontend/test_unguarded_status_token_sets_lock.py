"""The two closed status-token sets that nothing was enforcing.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Nine of the eleven `*_STATUS_TOKENS` arrays in the frontend are pinned by a Python
lock test that reads the array out of the source text and asserts the exact set --
the panels declare "MUST refuse to render any token not in this set", and those
tests are what make the declaration real.

Two were not:

  * REACT_USER_LEVEL_TEACHING_MODE_STATUS_TOKENS -- UserLevelTeachingMode.tsx had no
    lock test at all.
  * UNIFIED_PRODUCT_STATUS_TOKENS -- ide-product-shell-api.ts; the unified-navigation
    locks nearby do not read it.

Found 2026-07-28 while removing a blanket knip `ignore` over these directories. Once
knip could see them it reported both as unused exports -- and unlike the other nine,
that was almost true: nothing in TypeScript imports them and no Python test read
them, so a stated closed-set invariant was being enforced by nothing at all.

Deleting them was the wrong fix: the right one is the assertion the other nine
already have. Pinning the current set is the point -- changing a closed set should
require saying so here, which is exactly what the sibling locks do.

# ── the census, which is what this file got wrong about itself ────────────────
#
# The docstring above says "Nine of the eleven `*_STATUS_TOKENS` arrays in the frontend
# are pinned". Measured 2026-07-29 there are EIGHTEEN, and four were still unguarded:
#
#   REACT_LEARNING_STUDIO_PANEL_STATUS_TOKENS       ide-product-shell/LearningStudioPanel.tsx
#   REACT_MAINTENANCE_BAY_PANEL_STATUS_TOKENS       ide-product-shell/MaintenanceBayPanel.tsx
#   REACT_REPO_CLINIC_PANEL_STATUS_TOKENS           ide-product-shell/RepoClinicPanel.tsx
#   REACT_UNIFIED_NAVIGATION_PANEL_STATUS_TOKENS    ide-product-shell/UnifiedNavigationPanel.tsx
#
# So this lock closed two holes, declared the job done from a count that was wrong, and
# left four open. That is the same failure it was written to fix, one level up: the guard
# was fine, its INVENTORY was incomplete.
#
# Pinning the four by hand would repeat the mistake for the nineteenth set. Instead the
# census is asserted: enumerate every token set in the frontend and require each to be
# read by some test under tests/. A new panel that declares a closed set now fails here
# until somebody pins it, which is the only version of this guard that stays true.
