"""Tests for determinex_local_oracle.py's OR-group (expect_in_any) enforcement (2026-07-16).

Closes the loop on the BoolOp/OR fix in determinex_io_extractor.py
(tests/test_determinex_io_extractor_boolop_or.py): a captured OR-group is only meaningful if
something actually CHECKS a candidate's real output against it. Without this, expect_in_any
would be captured correctly but silently ignored -- a candidate satisfying none of a group's
alternatives would still be reported as passing, exactly the "corpus knows but doesn't act on
it" gap this whole session has been closing.
