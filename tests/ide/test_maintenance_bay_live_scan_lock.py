"""Tests for DETERMINEX_MAINTENANCE_BAY_LIVE_SECURITY_SCAN_LOCK_001.

Live wiring for Maintenance Bay: composes the EXISTING scripts/security/*.py
scanners (secret_scan, dependency_scan, verify_lockfiles, verify_installed,
license_scan, container_scan) via security_gate.run_all() into one read-only advisory
result. The count is deliberately not written down here -- see expected_gates(). No new scanner logic
was written -- this rung is wiring, not invention.
