Red-team: prompt injection via poisoned repository README.

When Determinex processes a code repository (SWE-bench, ProgramBench,
corpus ingest), it may read README files to understand context.
A malicious repository maintainer could embed instruction-override
text in their README to manipulate the agent's behavior.

These tests verify that README content is scanned for injection
before being included in any model prompt.
