"""Test for fix 39b (2026-07-17): resolver.learn() must process conftest.py BEFORE
the test file itself, so a name collision resolves in the test file's favor.

Root-caused via a REAL corpus-wide regression caught immediately after fix 39
shipped (resolver.learn(conf_tree) added, but in the WRONG order): ditaa's whole
test_svg.py defines its OWN module-level `RESOURCES = Path(__file__).parent.parent
/ "test_resources" / "test_svg"` (a test-file-SPECIFIC subdirectory), while
conftest.py SEPARATELY defines `RESOURCES = WORKSPACE / "test-resources"` (a
different, generic path) for its OWN fixtures' use. Real Python scoping means the
test file's own module-level name is the ONLY one ever visible inside it --
conftest.py's same-named global is a completely separate variable in a different
module's namespace, never merged as a bare name (only pytest FIXTURES cross that
boundary, via explicit dependency injection).

_PathResolver.learn() does a naive dict overwrite with no precedence logic --
calling resolver.learn(conf_tree) AFTER resolver.learn(tree) (fix 39's original,
buggy order) let conftest's WRONG value silently win, breaking resolution for
EVERY test in the file referencing the collided name: test_svg.py's own 30/31
resolved examples (fix 30's real, tested, verified recovery from earlier this same
session) dropped to 12/31 the moment fix 39 shipped. Caught by re-checking every
previously-fixed tool's real numbers after the resolver change, not by trusting
fix 39's own narrow tests alone -- exactly the discipline this whole session is
built on.

Fixed by learning conftest.py FIRST, then the test file itself SECOND, so the test
file's own definitions always win on a name collision.
