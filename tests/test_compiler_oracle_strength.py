"""What the Compiler Oracle actually verifies, per language.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The oracle is this system's entire reward signal -- CLAUDE.md: "Every training sample
in the corpus has passed a real compiler. This is the entire reward model." Measured
2026-07-28, `validate_project` had four branches and two of them verified almost
nothing:

  rust    -> cargo build        real type check
  go      -> go build ./...     real type check
  python  -> compileall         SYNTAX ONLY. Never executes a line, so a module-level
                                NameError, a bad import, or a reference to a function
                                that does not exist all produced "Compiler Oracle: PASS".
  else    -> return (True, "")  LENIENT PASS. TypeScript, Java, C, C++ all landed here,
                                so every step of such a session was recorded as verified
                                by nothing at all -- while CLAUDE.md listed `tsc` as
                                part of the oracle.

The lenient pass also contradicted the doctrine determinex_oracle.py was built to
enforce: "a stub raises OracleUnavailable with an install hint -- an oracle never
silently passes."

These tests pin the fix. They run the REAL oracle against real Docker, so they are
marked slow and skip when the sandbox backend is unavailable rather than passing
vacuously -- a skipped test says "not checked", a passing stub would say "verified",
which is the exact failure this file exists to prevent.
