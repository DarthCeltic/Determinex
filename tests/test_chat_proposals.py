"""Chat turns propose edits; they never write.

FOUND BY MEASUREMENT 2026-07-31, not by reading code. A chat session whose only message was "What
is the capital of France? Answer in one word." was run six times against the chat default
(qwen2.5-coder:3b-instruct) on a workspace holding one file. Five turns answered in prose. One
rewrote the workspace's main.rs from `println!("hi")` to `println!("Hello, world!")` -- an
unrequested edit to a source file, from a turn that asked nothing about code.

That is sampling, not prompt wording. Three separate prompt fixes were tried and measured first:
the local agent's system prompt, the order of its prompt sections, and finally the chat room's own
framing (which had been telling every participant to "make the edits that best move the task
forward"). The framing fix was real and necessary -- it took a conversational turn from a hard rc=1
failure to a clean prose answer -- but it could not make the unrequested write impossible, only
rarer. So the write became structurally unavailable: a chat turn emits a validated proposal, and
`apply_proposal` is the only path that puts bytes on disk.

What is verified here is the approval boundary itself: extraction, the staleness refusal that keeps
a proposal from discarding the user's own edit, all-or-nothing multi-file application, and the
refusal of a path that leaves the workspace. Approving a diff approves that change, not write
access to the disk.
