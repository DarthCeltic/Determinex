"""The chrono daemon must never park the build that feeds it.

THE BUG, found 2026-07-31 by running a hive session, not by reading code. Two sessions stalled at
the same point -- right after step 2's Compiler Oracle reported PASS -- and would have stalled
forever. Symptoms: identical CPU time across samples fifteen minutes apart, no child process, no
container, Ollama idle and answering unrelated requests in 24s, no error, no timeout, nothing in any
log after the PASS line.

Diagnosis needed `faulthandler.dump_traceback_later(150, repeat=True)`, which named both halves in
one dump:

    Thread (poll):  chrono_daemon._write_snapshot  <- line 650
                    chrono_daemon._poll_loop       <- line 644
    Thread (main):  chrono_daemon.record_compile_result  <- line 548
                    hive.executor.execute_step           <- line 1042

`_poll_loop` held `self._lock` and called `_write_snapshot()`, which takes `self._lock` itself. The
lock was a plain `threading.Lock`, so the poll thread deadlocked against itself while holding it,
and the main thread blocked behind it the moment the oracle recorded a compile result. Recording
that result is the FIRST thing that happens after a PASS, which is why it always presented as
"hangs right after the compiler succeeds".

Four wrong guesses came first -- Ollama, Docker, VRAM pressure, the thermal governor -- because all
four can also present as "stopped, no message". Hence these tests: they assert the property
("a poll tick cannot block a compile record") rather than any of those theories, and they run
against a real daemon with a real poll thread, because a mocked lock cannot deadlock.
