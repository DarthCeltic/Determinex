"""Tests for determinex_io_extractor.py's BoolOp(Or) / OR-group handling (2026-07-16), the
sixth fix in the skip-rate chain -- and the one built with a real schema decision, not a
quick pattern-match patch.

Found while investigating why the (ultimately zero-impact, see
test_determinex_io_extractor_fstring_resolution.py's module docstring) f-string sizing was
a false positive: the real skip cause for the sampled function was `assert A or B` -- a
top-level BoolOp shape _find_expectations didn't handle at all. Precisely sized (top-level
BoolOp specifically, not "BoolOp appears somewhere"): 172/627 (27.4%) of stgit's skips have
this shape -- the largest single bucket found in the whole investigation.

THE KEY DESIGN POINT: `assert A or B` is an OR-semantics claim (at least one branch must
hold). The existing `Example.expect_in` (`contains`) field is AND-semantics (every entry
must be present). Naively flattening both operands into `contains` would incorrectly demand
BOTH -- a genuinely correct reimplementation satisfying only one disjunct would then wrongly
fail an expectation the real test never imposed. `Example.expect_in_any` is a NEW field: a
list of OR-groups, each group a list of alternatives where at least one must be present.
`assert A and B` (a different BoolOp) is exactly equivalent to two separate asserts and
flattens safely into the existing AND-semantics `contains` -- no new field needed there.
