    """Added 2026-07-29, after a launch failure the transcript could not explain.

    determinex.exe links the MSVC runtime dynamically, so the runtime is THE dependency the
    installer must deliver. On a host that already has it the app starts whether or not the
    installer did its job -- a passing launch check there proves nothing. That is not
    theoretical: the first clean-host run failed launch because the MSI's VC++ custom action
    was being pruned away, and the second host had the runtime installed by then, which would
    have produced a green transcript for the wrong reason.

    Recorded rather than enforced: a GitHub Windows runner ships with the redistributable, so
    requiring absence would make that blessed path unsatisfiable. But the fact has to be IN
    the transcript, or a reader cannot distinguish a real proof from a vacuous one.
