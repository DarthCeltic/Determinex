"""tests/test_patch_advisor_overlap.py — assertion-string overlap signal.

Iter-1 lesson: family share alone over-predicts patchability. Advisor now
computes literal assertion-string overlap and penalizes confidence when
<30% of the failing tests in the target family actually expect the patch's
wording. These tests pin that contract.
