    The signing loop built its argument array in `$Args` and then ran

    Invoke-Checked runs the block as `& $Command` with no arguments, so inside the block `$Args`
    is that invocation's own empty argument list -- not the array built outside. `signtool @Args`
    therefore splatted nothing: signtool ran bare, printed usage, and the step failed with a
    generic nonzero exit that looks like a certificate problem. Verified directly:

        $Args = @("a","b"); & { $Args.Count }   -> 0
        $S    = @("a","b"); & { $S.Count }      -> 2

    Nothing caught it because the path is only reached once a signing thumbprint is configured,
    and `windows_trust` is still deferred pending a purchased certificate. It would have
    surfaced as a confusing failure on the first real signing attempt.

    The script used to do this, with a rationale that was false on its own platform:

    Measured on Windows 2026-07-30: after `$env:X = ""`, `Test-Path Env:\\X` is False,
    `[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('X')` is `$null`, and `cmd /c "if defined X"` reports
    UNDEFINED. Assigning an empty string DELETES the variable, and .NET's `SetEnvironmentVariable`
    documents the same. So "defined but empty" cannot be handed to a child process, and the guard was
    a no-op that read like a fix.

    The consequence was real rather than cosmetic: `tauri signer sign` genuinely blocks on a password
    prompt when the variable is absent, reproduced live until killed. A passwordless updater key
    therefore cannot satisfy the bundler's signing step at all, because the bundler takes no password
    flag. See docs/release/UPDATER_ARTIFACTS.md.
