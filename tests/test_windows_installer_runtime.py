"""Can the installed Windows app actually start on a machine that is not a dev box?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On 2026-07-29 the shipped MSI installed cleanly (exit 0) and produced an app that could not
start at all. `determinex.exe` died in loader initialisation with 0xC0000135
(STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND) about 2 s after launch, because it imports MSVCP140.dll and
MSVCP140_1.dll (plus VCRUNTIME140.dll transitively) and a clean Windows 11 image ships none of
them. A developer machine cannot reproduce it: any Visual Studio or VC++ redistributable
satisfies the dependency permanently.

The package was trying to handle it and failed twice over. `windows/vc_redist.wxs` declared a
CustomAction to run the redistributable it shipped, and (1) the WiX linker pruned the whole
fragment because nothing referenced it, silently, so the action was absent from the MSI while
`tauri build` reported success; and (2) once anchored so it genuinely ran, it returned 1618
(ERROR_INSTALL_ALREADY_RUNNING) because a nested install cannot run inside our own MSI
transaction, and Return="ignore" converted that into a silent success. Both faults produced a
green build and a green test suite.

So the runtime is now shipped app-local, beside the executable, where the loader looks first.
See frontend/src-tauri/CRT_RUNTIME.md.

The guard below is deliberately derived FROM THE BINARY, not from a list of DLL names. A
hardcoded list would have to be remembered every time a native dependency changes, and the
failure mode of forgetting is an app that cannot start. Parsing the import table means a new
must-ship dependency fails a test instead.

    An installed app rejects an update whose signature does not verify against the embedded public

    WHAT V2 ACTUALLY EMITS (corrected 2026-07-30, after this went green for the first time)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This test used to demand a `*.zip` as well, and stayed red for days partly because of it. With
    `createUpdaterArtifacts: true` the Windows artifact is the **installer itself plus a detached
    `.sig`** -- no archive. The zip belongs to the legacy `"v1Compatible"` mode, which the config
    schema describes as "Generates legacy zipped v1 compatible updaters", and the plugin's
    `install_inner` accepts either (`if infer::archive::is_zip(bytes)`), which is why a doc comment
    listing `.msi.zip` misled the original version of this check.

    So the requirement is the `.sig`, and demanding a zip asserted a shape this configuration is not
    supposed to produce -- a test failing for a reason unrelated to the real defect, which is worse
    than no test because it hides the moment the real defect is fixed.

    WHY THIS EXISTS
    ---------------
    Found live 2026-07-30. The updater fix replaced the signing keypair, so `plugins.updater.pubkey`
    changed and the app was rebuilt -- the public key is compiled INTO the binary. The staged bundle
    under .tmp/determinex-download-bundles/installers was not re-staged, so it still held installers
    carrying the OLD pubkey.

    Every release gate was green, because gate freshness anchors on the staged artifacts' own mtimes
    and those had not moved. But the staged installers can never accept an update signed with the new
    key, and the freshly built ones have no clean-host verification. So there was, at that moment, no
    publishable artifact set -- and nothing said so.

    Verified at the time: the fresh `determinex.exe` contains the new pubkey and not the old one, and
    both staged installers differ by sha256 from the freshly built ones.

    Deliberately not "fixed" by re-staging. Re-staging is correct but it moves the freshness anchor and
    invalidates real clean-host evidence that cost a VM run, so the two have to be sequenced together
    by whoever can do the VM run. This test exists to stop that being forgotten.

    Skips when there is no bundler output to compare against, since a clean checkout has none.
