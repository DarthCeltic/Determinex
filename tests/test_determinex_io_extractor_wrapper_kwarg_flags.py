"""Tests for determinex_io_extractor.py's wrapper-closure keyword-to-flag introspection
plus tmp_path/tmpdir scratch-path relativization (2026-07-17), the fourteenth fix in the
skip-rate chain -- the single largest deliberate build this session, after being sized and
initially deferred (see io_extractor_duckdb_kwarg_closure_lead_20260717 in
build_knowledge.json) then built once explicitly encouraged to push further.

Continuing the corpus-wide audit past fix 13, duckdb was the worst-performing tool in the
entire 201-tool corpus once correctly scoped to eval/tests/ (24/746 = 3.2% resolved). Root
cause: `run_duckdb(sql='...')` -- a fixture-factory whose returned closure builds
`cmd = [str(executable), temp_db]; if args: cmd.extend(args); if sql: cmd.extend(["-c",
sql])`. Sized: 4005 of 4015 total run_duckdb(...) calls use the sql= keyword. THREE
mechanisms were needed together:

(1) _track_scratch_path_fixtures -- a fixture yielding `str(tmp_path / "literal")` (pytest's
    own built-in fresh-per-test temp-dir fixtures) resolves to just the literal basename,
    since determinex_local_oracle.py already runs every Example in a fresh per-call uuid
    rundir -- a bare relative basename naturally lands in a fresh, empty location with ZERO
    oracle-side changes needed. Verified by reading _run_reimpl before assuming this was
    safe, not guessed.
(2) _discover_wrapper_kwarg_flags -- learns, from a runner's OWN body (or a returned inner
    closure's, the fixture-factory shape), which of its keyword params map to a literal CLI
    flag (`if sql: cmd.extend(["-c", sql])` -> {"sql": "-c"}), AND the wrapper's own fixed
    base argv elements (`cmd = [str(executable), temp_db]` -> ["executable", "test.db"],
    resolving the 'executable' placeholder even when it's bound to a local variable one
    assignment earlier rather than written inline).
(3) A real bug caught by hand-checking output, not just the aggregate count:
    `run_duckdb(args=["--csv"], sql="...")` initially lost BOTH the base and the sql-
    derived flag, because the existing ARGS_KW keyword handling REPLACES argv wholesale
    (designed for the simple `run(args=[...])` shape where args IS the entire invocation)
    -- for a wrapper with a learned base+flags contract, ARGS_KW must instead APPEND to the
    base like the wrapper's own `cmd.extend(args)` does. Fixed by branching on whether this
    specific runner name has learned wrapper info before choosing append-vs-replace
    semantics, so every OTHER tool's existing ARGS_KW behavior is untouched.

Real A/B counterfactual: duckdb went from 24/746 (3.2%) to 279/746 (37.4%) resolved.
Hand-verified a random sample of 15 recovered examples for correctness (argv element
order, SQL text, flag placement) before trusting the aggregate count -- caught the
append-vs-replace bug this way, which the recovery COUNT alone did not change (255 before
and after that specific fix) but which would have silently produced wrong Examples for
every combined args=+sql= call had it shipped uncaught.
