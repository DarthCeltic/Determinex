"""`determinex corpus fetch` — reconstruct a vendored tool from its own maintainers.

WHY THE COMMAND EXISTS. `corpus/` carries complete upstream checkouts of ~200 CLI tools, because
the Native Reimplementation Loop feeds real source and a real oracle to a model. That has to stay
available, but re-hosting it in the public repo fails twice:

  SIZE  the pack is 9.73 GiB; GitHub soft-limits at 1 GB and rejects files over 100 MB.
  LAW   publishing those trees is redistribution, and MIT/BSD/ISC/Apache-2.0 all require the
        copyright notice and license text to travel with the code.

So the public repo ships the knowledge layer and `canonical_tasks.json`, which pins
`repository` + `commit` for all 200 tasks, and this command rebuilds any tree from upstream at
exactly that commit.

The tests here are offline: network fetching is exercised separately and deliberately not in the
suite, because a unit test that clones 200 repositories is not a unit test.
