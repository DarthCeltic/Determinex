"""SETUP.md is the first thing a downloader reads. It must not claim more than the evidence.

FOUND 2026-07-31 by reading the generated file instead of the generator. Two of its claims were
false, and both were false in ways prose cannot avoid:

  "This is the verified Windows path: it has been installed, launched and uninstalled on a clean
   Windows host with no Visual C++ runtime present."

True of the artifact verified at the time, and false the next time anyone rebuilt — clean-host
evidence anchors to a specific installer HASH. Measured: the transcripts covered 5fdfe015, 3f72e1d4
and d1f369ef while the bundle being written contained 677273cb and 2942b161. The document whose
entire job is to prevent overclaiming was asserting clean-host verification for two binaries that
had never been near a clean host.

  "### Alternative: <nsis> (not clean-host verified) ... its clean-host check has not been re-run
   since a verification bug was fixed"

Stale in the *other* direction: NSIS had been clean-host verified hours earlier, so this steered
users away from a working installer for a reason that no longer held.

The lesson is the same both ways: a hardcoded sentence about gate state is wrong the moment the
state moves. Both are now derived — per artifact, from the transcript hashes.
