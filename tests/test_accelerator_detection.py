"""Does Determinex see the accelerator it is actually running on?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`hardware.profile_hardware` probed `nvidia-smi` and nothing else. On an AMD or Apple machine that
probe fails, so it fell through to `tier -1` = "CPU-only": a 24 GB Radeon or a 64 GB M3 Max was
invisible. The consequences are not cosmetic --

    tier -1  ->  max_local_models() == 0
                 max_parallel_steps == 1
                 lifecycle keep_hot == []          (nothing stays resident)

-- so the strongest available hardware was driven as the weakest possible host, while sitting on more
memory than the tier-2 threshold. AMD is the specific case that matters for a ROCm target.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT VERIFIED HERE
--------------------------------
NVIDIA is verified against the real machine this suite runs on. AMD, Intel Arc and Apple are verified
by **simulating the vendor tools' output**, because no such hardware is available here. That is a real
limitation and is stated rather than papered over: these tests prove the parsing, the unit scaling and
the tier arithmetic, NOT that `amd-smi` on a real MI300 prints what is simulated below. The formats
come from the documented CSV shapes.

The unit scaling is the part most likely to be silently wrong, so it is tested explicitly: `amd-smi`
reports MB while `rocm-smi --showmeminfo vram --csv` reports BYTES. Reading bytes as MB would put a
24 GB card in tier 0 and read as a merely-conservative choice rather than a bug.
