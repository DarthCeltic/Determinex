"""Tests for determinex_io_extractor.py's run-invoking-fixture fallback (2026-07-16), the
ninth fix in the skip-rate chain -- and the extra_vars extension to _find_expectations that
was needed to fully realize it for parametrized tests.

Found while continuing the tool-by-tool skip-rate audit onto lazygit (56.2% skip after
fix 8) -- a single file, test_help_output.py, had 45/47 tests skipped:

    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def help_long():
        return run_cmd(["--help"])

    def test_help_exit_code_zero(help_long):
        assert help_long.returncode == 0

_find_run_call(test_node, ...) walks the TEST's own body looking for a run-call -- there
isn't one, it's hoisted into the fixture to avoid re-invoking the executable for every
assertion. _is_result_rc/_is_result_out already match on attribute name alone
(`.returncode`/`.stdout`) regardless of how the base name was bound, so the expectation
side needed NO change for the common case -- only argv resolution was missing. Fix:
_track_run_fixtures() finds @pytest.fixture functions whose OWN body is a resolvable
run-call (reusing _find_run_call itself -- it doesn't care whether the FunctionDef it's
given is a test or a fixture), and any test naming exactly ONE such fixture as a parameter
uses that fixture's (argv, stdin, env, files) as a fallback when the test's own body has
none. Two-or-more fixture params (comparing help_long vs help_short) is a different shape
(comparing TWO invocations) this Example model can't express -- correctly left unresolved,
never guessed.

Real A/B counterfactual on lazygit's test_help_output.py: 2->13 examples with JUST the
fixture fallback. A further real gap surfaced: `test_help_documents_flag_tokens(help_long,
flag): assert flag in out` combines the fixture AND a parametrize value referenced directly
in the assertion -- _find_expectations was called ONCE per function, before the parametrize
case loop, so it had no way to know which concrete flag value applied to which case. Fixed
by giving _find_expectations an `extra_vars` parameter (merged into its internal vars_map)
and moving its call inside the per-case loop in extract_file(), and by teaching
_resolve_in_snippet to resolve a bare Name via vars_map (not just loop_vars/f-strings).
Final measured result on the same file: 2->40 examples (of 47 tests) -- skip rate
95.7%->14.9%, with every remaining skip a genuinely different, correctly-unresolvable shape
(generator expressions, re.search, a non-empty check, the two-fixture comparison). Across
the full 6-tool re-scan (3 branches each): lazygit 27->77 examples (89 tests), skip rate
56.2%->13.5%. Other tools unchanged (pattern not present in their sampled branches).
