"""Corpus sharing must be off by default, consented explicitly, and redacted provably.

The flywheel's symptom->fix classes are the product's compounding asset and they improve
with more contributors. They are also distilled FROM THE OPERATOR'S SOURCE, which is the one
thing this project exists to keep local. So the upload path gets the same treatment as the
oracle: assume it will be wrong, and make the failure loud.

Three properties, each of which has been a real incident somewhere:

1. **Off by default.** Not "on with an opt-out". A default that shares is a default that
   ships someone's proprietary code to a public dataset the first time they run an update.
2. **A flag is not consent.** `DETERMINEX_CORPUS_SHARE=1` can be set by a wrapper script,
   a Dockerfile, or a teammate. A recorded consent file is a deliberate human act.
3. **Redaction is verified after it runs**, not assumed from the pattern list. A redactor
   nobody re-scans has unknown coverage, and unknown coverage on an upload path is the
   entire risk.
