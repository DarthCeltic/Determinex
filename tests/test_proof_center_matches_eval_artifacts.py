"""Does the Proof Center show the scores the models actually earned?

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Found 2026-07-29. `frontend/src/app/proof-center/page.tsx` hardcoded a model benchmark
table that credited the SHIPPED models with their PREDECESSORS' scores:

    displayed                        artifact on disk
    C1 Engineer v11-dsl  89% 40/45   57/70 = 81%   (40/45 belongs to v10-dsl)
    C3 Observer  v6-dsl  82% 37/45   53/70 = 76%   (37/45 belongs to v5-dsl)
    C7 Sentinel  v5-dsl  87% 39/45   NO ARTIFACT   (39/45 belongs to v3)
    System Combined      86% 116/135 a sum of the three above

CLAUDE.md carries exactly this correction, dated 2026-07-28: "README, WHITE_PAPER and
ARCHITECTURE had been crediting the shipped v11/v6 models with v10/v5's scores...
Sentinel v5-dsl genuinely has no eval artifact." Three prose documents were corrected.
The product page -- the one surface whose entire purpose is showing verified proof -- was
not, and nothing existed to notice.

So this test does not compare the page against CLAUDE.md. Prose is what drifted. It
compares the page against `logs/eval_results/*.json`, the artifacts the eval harness
wrote, because those are the only thing that cannot be edited into agreement.

The 45-probe and 70-probe sets are NOT interchangeable -- different denominators,
different probe content -- so a score from one may not be shown against, or summed with,
the other. That conflation is what produced the original row.
