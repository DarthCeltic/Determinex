"""The `determinex` console script must be reachable from an INSTALL, not just a checkout.

`[project.scripts]` declares `determinex = "scripts.determinex_cli:main"`, so a built wheel has to
contain a `scripts` package or the command fails at import — and every user-facing instruction in
the README is written as `determinex <cmd>`.

That works today, but it works by way of a DEFAULT nobody asserts. `scripts/` has no `__init__.py`,
so it is an implicit namespace package: `find_packages()` does not see it (measured — it returns
only `determinex_trainer`), and `find_namespace_packages()` does. setuptools' pyproject discovery
enables namespaces by default, which is the only reason `determinex.egg-info/top_level.txt` lists
`scripts` at all. Set `namespaces = false` under `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]`, or narrow
`include`, and the wheel silently ships without the module its own console script points at. The
checkout would keep working the whole time, because the repo root is on `sys.path` there.

Found 2026-07-31 while adding `determinex build` and checking whether the README's `determinex
build --idea ...` was a claim I could actually make. Same shape as the rest of tonight's defects:
a thing that holds for a reason nothing states.

Deliberately asserts on CONFIG rather than calling `find_namespace_packages()`: that call takes
~25 minutes on this ~10 GiB checkout, which is not a unit test.
