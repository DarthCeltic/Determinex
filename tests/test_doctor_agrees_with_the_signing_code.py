"""`determinex doctor` must predict what the corpus signing code will actually do.

MEASURED 2026-07-31 by running two documented commands back to back:

    $ determinex doctor
      ✗ hmac_key   DETERMINEX_HMAC_KEY not set — corpus rows will not be signed
          → fix: set DETERMINEX_HMAC_KEY=<random 32+ bytes hex> in .env

    $ python scripts/determinex_hive.py new-session --spec my_spec.md --lang rust
      [SAFETY] No DETERMINEX_CORPUS_HMAC_KEY set — using session-ephemeral HMAC key

Two different variable names for one knob, and the diagnostic named the wrong one. Wrong in both
directions:

  * Follow doctor's fix and set DETERMINEX_HMAC_KEY -> doctor turns green while corpus rows stay
    unsigned, because determinex_safety, hive/workspace and corpus/corpus_manager each read
    DETERMINEX_CORPUS_HMAC_KEY directly and consult no settings object. A warning reported as
    resolved that is not resolved is worse than the warning.
  * Set DETERMINEX_CORPUS_HMAC_KEY, the name that actually works -> doctor reports "not set".

And a second, sharper mismatch in the same check: `determinex_safety._load_hmac_key` requires
`bytes.fromhex(raw)` to parse and yield >= 32 BYTES, i.e. 64 hex characters. Doctor compared
`len(key) < 32` against the hex STRING, so a 32-hex-char (16-byte) key was reported ACTIVE and
then silently rejected by the signing code.

These tests pair the two sides for every input class, so the pair cannot drift apart again.
determinex_settings.py already carries a comment about having had this precedence backwards once;
that makes this the third place the same fact is written down.

One honest note on the byte-length case. Checked against the original implementation, the
alias-only and canonical-only tests both fail it, as intended. The short-key test does NOT --
because the old check read only DETERMINEX_HMAC_KEY, it never reached its own length comparison
when the canonical variable was the one set. The string-vs-bytes bug was therefore LATENT, made
live by fixing the variable name. It is guarded here because it is real now, not because it ever
fired.
