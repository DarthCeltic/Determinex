 * The taxonomy is only worth anything if it stays exhaustive. The mess it

 * whichever of four overlapping menus the author happened to remember -- so
 * Review and Merge ended up reachable from none of them.
 *
 * These tests read the REAL type unions out of page.tsx instead of a
 * hand-copied list, so adding a panel without giving it a home fails here
 * rather than silently producing another orphan.

 * three separate times in one sitting:
 *
 *   1. the comment named the removed member in double quotes, so the member regex put it
 *      straight back into the parsed list;
 *   2. the rewrite used the word describing the hazard, in double quotes, and was itself
 *      parsed as a member;
 *   3. the next rewrite contained a semicolon, and the lazy `[\s\S]*?;` terminated the
 *      union block early -- 13 members parsed out of 21, so most of the union silently
 *      vanished from the check.
 *
 * Contorting comments to please a regex is the wrong end to fix. Comments are stripped
 * before any parsing, so prose can say whatever it needs to.

 * own comment describes -- a taxonomy entry pointing at an addon with nothing to render.
 * But it checked membership of the WorkspaceAddon TYPE UNION, and a type union is just a
 * list of allowed strings: adding `| "idea"` satisfies it while no panel exists.
 *
 * Measured 2026-07-29: `idea` ("Idea Lab") was advertised in the taxonomy, present in the
 * union, absent from `addonItems` -- so `selectedAddon` resolved to null, the dock render
 * is guarded by `addonDockOpen && selectedAddon`, and clicking the menu item did
 * NOTHING. The guard written to prevent exactly that passed the whole time, because it
 * never looked at panels.
 *
 * This reads the registry entries instead: an id only counts when something renders it.
