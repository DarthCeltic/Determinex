/**
 * Every component must take its colours, fonts and sizes from the skin.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Measured 2026-07-29: 681 literal hex colours across the components, 28 files using the
 * GitHub palette (#0d1117 x97, #30363d x168, #161b22 x55) against 32 using the skin
 * variables. A skin applies its palette as CSS custom properties on the root element, so
 * a literal hex IGNORES ALL 27 SKINS -- picking a theme changed half the app and left the
 * other half alone. Same for a hardcoded font stack: skins define their own.
 *
 * That was invisible because it is not a type error and not a test failure; it only shows
 * up by switching skin and looking. This test is the thing that looks.
 *
 * It is a FLOOR, not a freeze: the counts below are allowances that may be lowered as
 * one-off colours are tokenised, and lowering them is the intended direction. Raising one
 * requires saying so here, in a diff, with a reason.

 * Remaining one-off literal colours across all components. Measured 2026-07-29:

 *   681  before any tokenisation
 *   196  after round 1 (chrome + primary semantics, 474 values)
 *   137  after round 2 (surfaces, text ramp, single-use semantics, 59 values)
 *
 * What is left is skin-independent BY DESIGN, and tokenising it would be wrong:
 *
 *   ~96  LoadingThemes/* -- each animation paints ONE specific skin's identity. Pointing
 *        them at the active skin would make every loader look the same and destroy the
 *        reason per-skin loaders exist.
 *   ~13  PolicyBlockOverlay's amber ramp -- eight distinct shades forming a gradient.
 *        Collapsing a ramp onto a single --dtx-warn flattens it into a solid block; a ramp
 *        needs derived ramp tokens, which is a design change, not a substitution.
 *
 * Set to the exact measured number, not a round one above it, so this is a ratchet: it
 * fails on the FIRST new literal rather than after a budget's worth. Lowering it is the
 * intended direction; raising it requires saying so here, with a reason.
